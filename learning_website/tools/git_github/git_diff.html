<h4><pre>
1. Git diff is a command-line utility. It's a multiuse Git command.
2. When it is executed, it runs a diff function on Git data sources. 
3. These data sources can be files, branches, commits and more. 
4. It is used to show changes between commits, commit and working tree etc.
5. However, we can also track the changes with the help of git log command with option -p. 

Let's understand different scenarios where we can utilize the git diff command.

Scenario 1. Track the changes that have not been staged.
The usual use of git diff command is that we can track the changes that have not been staged.

<mark>Example -> $ git diff</mark>

Scenario 2. Track the changes that have staged but not commited.
We can track the changes in the staging area.

<mark>Example -> $ git diff --staged</mark>

Scenario 3. Track the changes after committing a file.
Git let us track the changes after commiting a file. Suppose we have commited a file for the repository and made some additional changes after the commit.
We can track the file at this stage also.

<mark>Example -> $ git diff HEAD</mark>

Scenario 4. Track the changes between two commits.
We can track the changes between two different commits. Git allows us to track changes between two commits, whether it is the latest commit or the old commit.
Suppose, we want to track the changes of a specified from an earlier commit. To do so, we must need the commits of the of that specified file.
To display the commits of any specified, run the git log command as:

<mark>Example -> $ git log -p --follow -- filename</mark>

Note:-> The above command will display all the commits of a specified file.

Now, pick any two commits and mention those on below command to see or track the changes.   

<mark>Example -> $ git diff commit1-sha commit2-sha</mark>

Scenario 5. Git different branches
1. We can track the changes of the branch with thw git status command, but few more commands can explain it in detail.
2. The git diff command is a widely used tool to track the changes.

<mark>Example -> $ git diff branch1 branch2</mark>
