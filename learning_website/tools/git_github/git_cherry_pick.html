<h4><pre>
1. Cherry-picking in git stands for applying some commit from one branch into another branch.
2. In case you made a mistake and commited a change into the wrong branch, but do not want to merge the whole branch. You can revert the commit and apply it on another branch.   
3. The main motive of a cherry-pick is to apply the changes introduced by some existing commit.
4. The cherry-pick looks at a pervious commit in the repository history and update the changes that were part of the last commit to the current working tree.

Why Cherry-Pick

Suppose you are working with a team of developers on a medium to large-sized project. Some changes proposed by another team member and you want to apply some of them to your
main project, not all. Since managing the changes between several git branches can become a complex task, and you don't want to merge a whole branch into another branch.
You only need to pick one or two specific commits. To pick some changes into your main project branch from other branches is called cherry-picking.

Steps to do cherry-picking - 
1. Copy the particular commit id that you want to make on the master branch.
2. Now switch to the master branch and cherry-pick it there.

Example -> $ git cherry-pick commit_id

Some scenarious in which you can cherry-pick:
Scenario 1: Accidently make a commit in a wrong branch 
Scenario 2: Make the changes proposes by another team member. 

Usage of cherry pick:
1. It is handy tool for team collaboration.
2. It is necessary in case of bug fixing because bugs are fixed and tested in the development branch with their commits.
3. It is mostly used in undoing changes and restoring lost commits.
4. You can avoid useless conflicts by using by using git cherry-pic instead of other options.
5. It is useful tool when a full branch merge is not possible due to incompatible versions in the various branches.
6. The git cherry-pick is used to access the changes introduced to a sub-branch, without changing the branch.
