<html><h2><u>Git Stashing</u></h2>
<h4><pre>
Suppose you are implementing a new feature for you product. Your code is in progress and suddenly a customer escalation comes. Because of this, you have
to keep aside your new feature work for few hours.
You cannot commit your partial code and also cannot throw away your changes. So you need some temporary storage, where you can store you partial changes
and later on commit it.

Sometimes you want to switch the branches, but you are working on an incomplete part of your current project. You don't want to make a commit of half-done work.
Git stashing allows you to do so. The git stash command enables you to switch branches without committing the current branch.

-> <mark>To stash an item (only applies to modified files, not new files).</mark>

Stashing takes the messy state of your working directory, and temporarily save it for furthur use. Many options are available with git stash.
Some useful options are below.

a. Git stash
b. Git stash save
c. Git stash list
d. Git stash apply
e. Git stash changes
f. Git stash pop
g. Git stash drop
h. git stash clear
i. git stash branch


<h3><u>a. To stash an item -</u></h3>
$ git stash

<h3><u>b. Git stash save (Saving stashes with the message) -</u></h3>
$ git stash save "stashing message"

<h3><u>c. Git stash list (check the stored stash) -</u></h3>
$ git stash list

<h3><u>d. Git Stash Apply -</u></h3>
You can re-apply the changes that you just stashed by using the git stash command.
$ git stash apply stash_id

<mark>If we don't specify a stash, Git takes the most recent stash and tries to apply it.</mark>

<h3><u>e. Git Stash Changes -</u></h3>
We can track the stashes and their changes. To see the changes in the file before stash and after stash operation, run the below command.
$ git stash show

<mark>Note: We can exactly track what changes are made on the file. To display the changed content of the file, perform the below command:</mark>
$ git stash show -p

-p stands for partial stash. 

<mark>Note: The above command will acts the same as git diff command. The git diff command will also show the exact output.</mark> 

<h3><u>f. Git Stash Pop (Reapplying Stashed Changes)-</u></h3>
Git allows the user to re-apply the previous commits by using git stash pop command. The popping option removes the changes from stash and applies
them to your working file.
$ git stash pop

<mark>Note: The git stash pop command is quite similar to git stash apply. The main difference between both of these commands is stash pop command
that deletes the stash from the stack after it is applied.</mark>   

<h3><u>g. Git Stash Drop (Unstash)-</u></h3>
The git stash drop command is used to delete a stash from the queue. Generally, it deletes the most recent stash. Caution should be taken before using
stash drop command, as it is diffcult to undo if once applied.
The only way to revert it is if you do not close the terminal after deleting the stash. 
$ git stash drop

If you want to pop not the recent one, then
$ git stash drop stash_id 


<h3><u>h. Git stash clear -</u></h3>
The git stash clear command allows deleting all the available stashes at once. 
$ git stash clear

<h3><u>i. Git stash branch -</u></h3>
The git stash branch command allows the user to stash work on separate branch to avoid conflicts. 
$ git stash branch Branch_Name
