<html><h2><u><center>Git Head</center></u>
-> The HEAD points out the last commit in the current checkout branch.
-> It is like a pointer to any reference.
-> The HEAD can be understood as the "current branch".
-> When you switch branches with 'checkout', the HEAD is transferred to the new branch.
-> It stores the status of HEAD in .git/refs/heads directory.

Example -> $ git show head

<mark>Note: You can view the HEAD status from git log and git show recent_commit_id commands.</mark>

<h3><u>Git Detached Head -</u></h3>
-> When HEAD doesn't point to most recent commit, such state is called detached Head.
-> If you checkout with an older commit, it will stand the detached head condition. 

Example -> $ git checkout commit_id

<mark>Note: it always recommended, do not commit on detached Head.</mark>
