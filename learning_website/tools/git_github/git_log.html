<h4><pre>
1. Git log is a utility tool to review and read a history of everything that happens to a repository. Multiple options can be used with a git log to make history nore specific.
2. Generally, the git log is a record of commits. A git log contains the following data:
a. A commit hash - It is a 40 character checksum data generated by SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) algorithm. It is a unique number.
b. Commit Author metadata: The information of authors such as author nama and email.
c. Commit Data metadata: It's a data timestamp for the time of the commit.
d. Commit title/ message: It is the overview of the commit given in the commit message.

Basic Git log:- The basic git log command will display the most recent commits and the status of the head. 

<mark>Example - $ git log</mark>

Note: We can perform some action like scrolling, jumping, move and quit on the command line. To scroll on the command line pree k for moving up, j for moving down
the spacebar for scrolling down by a full page and q to quit from the command line.

Git Log Oneline -
1. The oneline option is used to display the output as one commit per line.
2. It also shows the output in brief like the first seven characters of the commit SHA and the commit message.

<mark>Example -> $ git log --oneline</mark>

So, usually we can say that --oneline flag causes git log to display:
a. one commit per line
b. the first seven characters of the SHA
c. the commit message 

Git Log Stat -
1. The git log stat command displays the files that have been modified.
2. It also shows the number if lines and summary line of the total records that have been updated.

<mark>Example -> $ git log --stat</mark>

Generally, we can say that the stat option is used to display -
a. the modified files
b. The number of lines that have been added or removed
c. A summary line of the total number of records changed
d. The lines that have been added or removed

Git log P or Patch
1. The git log patch command displays the files that have been modified. It also shows the location of the added, removed and updated lines.

<mark>Example -> $ git log --patch or $ git log -p</mark>

Generally, we can say that the --patch flag is used to display:
a. Modified files
b. The location of the lines that you added or removed
c. Specific changes that have been made.

Git Log Graph
1. The git log command allows viewing your git log as a graph. 

<mark>Example -> $ git log --graph</mark>

2. To make the output more specific, you can combine the command with --oneline option.

<mark>Example -> $ git log --graph --oneline</mark>

Filtering the commit history
1. We can filter the output according to our needs. 
2. We can apply many filters like amount, data, author and more on output. 

By Amount
1. We can limit the number of output commit by using git log command . 
2. This command will remove the complexity if you are interested in fewer commits.

<mark>example -> git log -3</mark>

By Date and Time:
We can filter the output by date and time. We have to pass --after or --before argument to specify the date.
These both argument accept a variety of date formats.

<mark>Example -> $ git log --after="yy-mm-dd"</mark>

We can also pass the applicable reference statement like "yesterday", "1 week ago", "21 days ago" and more.

<mark>Example -> $ git log --after="21 days ago"</mark>

We can also track the commits between two dates.

<mark>Example -> $ git log --after"2019-11-01" --before="2019-11-08"</mark> 

Note: We can also use --since and --until instead of --after and --before. Because they are synonyms, respectively.

By Author:
1. We can filter the commits by a particular user. Suppose, we want to list the commits only made by a particular team member.
2. We can use --author flag to filter the commits by author name.
3. This command takes a regular expression and returns the list of commits made by authors that match that pattern.
4. You can use exact name instead of the pattern.

<mark>Example -> $ git log --author="Author name"</mark>

5. Author's name doesn't need to be an exact match; it just has the specified phrase.

Example -> $ git log --author="@gmail.com"</mark>

By Commit message:
We can use the short form of commit mesaage instead of a complete message.

<mark>Example -> $ git log --grep="Commit message"</mark>

Note: There are many other filtering options available like we can filter by file name, content and more.
