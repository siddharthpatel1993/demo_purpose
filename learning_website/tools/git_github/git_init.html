<html><h2><u>Git Init </u></h2> 
<h4><pre>
The git init command is the first command that you will run on Git. The git init command is used to create a new blank repository. It is used to make an existing project
as a Git project. <mark>Several Git commands run inside the repository, but init command can be run outside of the repository. </mark>

The git init command creates a .git subdirectory in the current working directory. This newly created subdirectory contains all of the necessary metadata. These metadata 
can be categorized into objects, refs, and temp files. It also initializes a HEAD pointer for the master branch of the repository.

<u><h3>Creating the first repository - </h3></u> 
Git version control system allows you to share projects among developers. For learning Git, it is essential to understand that how can we create a project on Git. A 
repository is a directory that contains all the project-related data. There can also be more than one project on a single repository.

We can create a repository for blank and existing projects. Let's understand how to create a repository.

<u><h3>Create a Repository for a Blank (New) Project -</h3></u> 
To create a blank repository, open command line on your desired directory and run the init command as follows:

<mark>$ git init</mark>  
The above command will create an empty .git repository. Suppose we want to make a git repository on our desktop. To do so, open Git Bash on the desktop and run the above 
command.

Now we can create and add files on this repository for version control.

To create a file, run the cat or touch command as follows:

<mark>$ touch file_Name</mark>  
To add files to the repository, run the git add command as follows:

<mark>$ git add file_Name</mark>  

<u><h3>Create a Repository for an existing project -</h3></u>
If you want to share your project on a version control system and control it with Git, then, browse your project's directory and run the below command:

Syntax:

<mark>$ git init </mark>  

The above command will create a new subdirectory named .git that holds all necessary repository files. The .git subdirectory can be understood as a Git repository skeleton.


An empty repository .git is added to my existing project. If we want to start version-controlling for existing files, we have to track these files with git add command, 
followed by a commit.

We can list all the untracked files by git status command.

<mark>$ git status</mark>    

The list of all untracked files is displayed by the git status command. 

We can track all the untracked files by Git Add command.

<u><h3>Create a Repository and Directory Together -</h3></u>
The git init command allows us to create a new blank repository and a directory together. The empty repository .git is created under the directory. Suppose I want to create 
a blank repository with a project name, then we can do so by the git init command. Consider the below command:

<mark>$ git init NewDirectory</mark> 
The above command will create an empty .git repository under a directory named NewDirectory.
