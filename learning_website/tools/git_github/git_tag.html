<html><h2><u>Git Tag</u></h2>
<h4><pre>
-> Tags make a point as a specific point in Git history.
-> Tags are used to mark a commit stage as relevant.
-> Primarily, it is used to make a project's initial point like v1.1.
-> Tags are like branches, and they do not change once initiated.
-> We can have any number of tags on a branch or different branches.
-> Tag operation allows giving meaningful names to a specific verison in the repository.

<h3><u>When to create a tag -</u></h3>
 - When you want to create a release point for a stable version of your code.
 - When you want to create a historical point that you can refer to reuse in future.

<h3><u>Git Create Tag -</u></h3>
-> To create a tag, checkout to the branch where you want to create a tag.

Example -> $ git tag tagname or $ git tag tagname commit_id

<h3><u>Git List tag-</u></h3>
We can list the available tags in our repository as follows:
1. git tag
2. git show
3. git tag -l ".*"

<u>Git tag -</u> 
It is most generally used option to list all the available tag from the repository. It is used as:
 
Example -> $ git tag

<u>Git Show -</u>
It is specific command used to display the details of a particular tag.

Example -> $ git show tagname

<u>git tag -l ".*" -</u>
It is also a specific comamnd line tool. It displays the available tags using wild card pattern. 

Example -> git tag -l "pattern"

<h3><u>Types of Git tags-</u></h3>
There are two types of tag in git :-
a. Annotated Tags
b. Light-weighted tag

<u>Annotated Tags -</u>
-> Annotated Tags are tags that store extra Metadata like developer name, email, date and more.
-> They are stored as a bundle of objects in the Git database.
-> If you are pointing and saving a final version of any project, then it is recommended to create an annotated tag.
-> But if you want to make a temporary make point or don't want to share information, then you can create a light-weight tag.

Example -> $ git tag tagname -m tag message

<u>Light-weighted Tags-</u>  
-> Git supports one more type of tag; it is called as Light-weighted tag.
-> The motive of both the tags is the same as marking a point in the repository.
-> It doesnot store unnecessary information to keep it light-weight.
-> No command line option such as -a, -s or -m are supplied in light-weighted tag, just pass the tag name.

Example -> git tag tagname 

<h3><u>Git Push Tag-</u></h3>
-> We can push tags to a remote server project.
-> It will help other team members to know where to pick an update.
-> It will show as release point on a remote server account.
-> The git push command facilitates with some specific options to push tags. They are as follow :-
   a. Git push origin tagname
   b. Git push origin -tags/ Git push --tags

<u>Git push origin tagname-</u>
We can push any particular tag by using git push command.

Example -> $ git push origin tagname

<mark>Note: The above command will push the specified tag name as a release point.</mark>

<u>Git push origin --tags/ Git push --tags-</u> 
-> The given command will push all the available tags at once.
-> It will create as much release point as the number of tags available in the repository.

Example -> $ git push origin --tags or $ git push --tags

<h3><u>Git Delete Tag-</u></h3>
Git allows deleting a tag from the repository at any moment.

Example -> $ git tag -d tagname or $ git tag --delete tagname

<h3><u>Delete a Remote Tag-</u></h3>
We can also delete a tag from the remote server.

Example -> $ git push origin -d tagname or $ git push origin --delete tagname

<h3><u>Delete Multiple Tags-</u></h3>
We can delete more than one tag just from command line. 

Example -> $ git tag -d tag1 tag2

We can also delete multiple tags from the remote server. To delete tags from the server origin, run the below command:

Example -> $ git push origin -d tag1 tag2 

<h3><u>Git Checkout Tags-</u></h3>
-> There is no actual conecpt of checkout the tags in git. However, we can do it by creating a new branch from a tag.

Example -> $ git checkout -b new_branch_name tag_name

<mark>The above command will create a new branch with the same state of the repository as it is in the tag.</mark>
