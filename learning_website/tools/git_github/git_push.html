<h4><pre>
1. The push term refers to upload or an act of transfer commits from local repository(local refs) content to a remote repository(remote refs). 
2. Pushing is capable of overwriting changes; caution should be taken when pushing.
<mark>3. If we don't specify the location of a repository, then it will push to default location at origin master.</mark>

example -> $ git push option [Remote_URL branch_name refspec ...]

<u>Push command supports many additional options. Some options are as follows under push tags.</u>

<h3><u>Git Push Tags:-</u></h3>
<u>repository:</u> The repository is the destination of a push operation. It can be either a URL or the name of the remote repository.

<u>refspec:</u> It specifies the destination ref to update source object.

<u>--all:</u> The word "all" stands for all branches. It pushes all branches.

<u>--prune:</u> It removes the remote branches that do not have a local counterpart. Means, if you have a remote branch say demo, if this branch
         does not exist locally, then it will be removed.
		 
<u>--mirror:</u> It is used to mirror the repository to the remote. Updated or newly created local refs will be pushed to the remote end.
          It can be force updated on the remote end. The deleted refs will be removed from the remote end.
		  
<u>--dry-run:</u> Dry run tests the commands. It does all this except originally update the repository.

<u>--tags:</u> It pushes all local tags.

<u>--delete:</u> It deletes the specific branch.

<u>-u:</u> It creates an upstream tracking connection. It is very useful if you are going to push the branch for the first time.

<h3><u>Git Push Origin Master:-</u></h3>
1. Git push origin master is a special command-line utility that specifies the remote branch and directory.
2. When you have multiple branches and directory, then this command assists you in determining your main branch and repository.
3. Generally, the term origin stands for the remote repository, and master is considered as the main branch.
4. So, the entire statement "git push origin master" pushes the local content on the master branch of the remote location.

example -> git push origin master

<h3><u>Git Force Push:-</u></h3>
The git force push allows you to push local repository to remote without dealing with conflicts. It is used as follows:

Syntax -> $ git push remote branch -f
or 
           $ git push remote branch --force

Example -> git push origin master -f

Where, -f version is used as an abbreviation of force.
       remote can be any remote location like GitHub, Subversion, or any other git service
       branch is a particular branch name.

Note: 1. We can also omit the branch in this command.

Example -> git push remote -f

2. We can omit both the remote and branch. 

Example -> git push -f 

3. When the remote and branch both are ommited, the default behaviour is determinded by push.default setting of git config.

<h3><u>Git push -v/--verbose:-</u></h3>
It pushes the repository and gives a detailed explanation about objects.

For example -> $ git push -v or $ git push --verbose

<h3><u>Delete a Remote Branch:-</u></h3>
We can delete a remote branch using git push. It allows removing a remote branch from the command line. 

Example -> git push origin --delete branch_name
