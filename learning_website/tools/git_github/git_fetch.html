<h4><pre>
1. The "git fetch" command is used to fetch the updates from remote-tracking branches. 
2. It downloads commits, objects and refs from another repository. It also fetches branches and tags from one or more repositories.
3. Additionally, we can get the updates that have been pushed to our remote branches to our local machine.
4. As we know, a branch is a variation of our repositories main code, so the <mark>remote-tracking branches are the branches that have been set up to pull and push from remote 
   repository.</mark>

<h3><u>Ways to fetch Git Repository-</u></h3>
<u>Scenario 1. To Fetch the remote repository:-</u>
We can fetch the complete repository with the help of fetch command from a repository URL like a pull command does.

<mark>Example -> git fetch repository_URL</mark>

<u>Scenario 2. To fetch a specific branch:-</u>
We can fetch a specific branch from a repository. It will only access the element from a specific branch. 

<mark>Example -> git fetch branch_url branch_name</mark>

<u>Scenario 3. To fetch all the branches simultaneously:-</u>
The git fetch command allows to fetch all branchs simultaneously from a remote repository.

<mark>Example -> git fetch -all</mark> 

<u>Scenario 4. To synchronize the local repository:-</u>
Suppose, your team member has added some new features to your remote repository. So, to add these updates to your local repository, use the git fetch command. It is used as 
follow.

<mark>Example -> git fetch origin</mark>

Note:
1. The git fetch can fetch from either a single named repository or URL or from several repositories at once.
2. It can be considered as the safe version of the git pull commands.
3. The git fetch downloads the remote content but not update your local repo's working state.
4. When no remote server is specified, by default, it will fetch the origin remote. 


Some command after git fetch

git checkout origin/master -> after fetching you can view the changes made in remote 
git log -> check through git log
git diff master origin/master
git diff master origin/master --stat
git log master..origin/master
git log origin/master..master
