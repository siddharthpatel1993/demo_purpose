<html><h2><u><center>Git Remote</center></u>
<h4><pre>
-> In Git, the term remote is concerned with the remote repository. 
-> A remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like an internal server, GitHub, Subversion and more.
-> The developers can perform many operations with the remoter server such as clone, push, pull and more.

<h3><u>Check your remote -></u></h3>
-> To check the configuration of the remote server, run the git remote command.
-> The git remote command allows accessing the connection between remote and local.
-> If you want to see the original existance of your cloned repository, use the git remote command.

Example -> $ git remote

<mark>Note: The given command would provide the remote name as the origin. Origin is the default name of the remote server, which is given my git.</mark>

<h3><u>Git remote -v -></u></h3>
-> Git remote supports a specific option -v to show URLs that Git has stored as a short name.
-> These short names are used during the reading and writing operation.
-> Here, -v stands for verbose. We can use --verbose in place of -v.

Example -> $ git remote -v or $ git remote --verbose

<h3><u>Git remote Add -></u></h3>
-> When we fetch a repository implicitley, git adds a remote for the repository.
-> Also, we can explicitly add a remote for a repository.
-> We can add a remote as a short nickname or short name.

Example -> $ git remote add short_name remote_URL

<h3><u>Fetching and pulling -></u></h3>
-> You can fetch and pull data from the remote repository.
-> The fetch and pull command goes out to that remote server, and fetch all the data from the remote project that you don't have yet.
-> These commands let us fetch the references to all the branches from the remote.

Example -> $ git fetch remote_URI

To clone the remote repository from your remote projects, run the below command:

Example -> $ git clone remote_URI

When we clone a repository, the remote repository is added by a default name "origin". So, mostly, the command is used as git fetch origin.

<mark>Note: The git fetch origin fetches the updates that have been made to the remote server since you cloned it. The git fetch command only downloads the data
to the local repository; it doesn't merge or modify the data until you don't operate. You have to merge it manually into your repository when you want. </mark>

To pull the repository, run the below command:
Example -> $ git pull remote

<mark>Note: The git pull command automatically fetches and then merges the remote data into your current branch. Pulling is an easier and comfortable workflow
than fetching. Because the git clone command sets up your local master branch to track the remote master branch on the server your cloned.</mark>

<h3><u>Pushing to Remote Branch -></u></h3>
-> If you want to share the your project, you have to push it upstream.
-> The git push command is used to share a project or send updates to the remote server.

Example -> $ git push remote branch

<mark>It is a special command-line utility that specifies the remote branch and directory. When you have multiple branches on a remote server, then this command
assists you to specify your main branch and repository.</mark>

<h3><u>Git Remove Remote -></u></h3>
You can remove a remote connection from a repository.

Example -> $ git remote rm destionation or $ git remote remove destionation

<h3><u>Git Remove Rename -></u></h3> 
Git allows renaming the remote server name so that you can use a short name in place of the remote server name. 

Example -> $ git remote rename old_name new_name

<h3><u>Git Show remote -></u></h3>
To see additional information about a particular remote, use the git remote command along with show sub-command. It is used as:

Example -> $ git remote show remote_name

<h3><u>Git change remote(changing a Remote's URL) -></u></h3>
The git remote set command is used to change the URL of the repository. It changes an existing remote repository URL.

Example -> $ git remote set-url remote_name new_URL
