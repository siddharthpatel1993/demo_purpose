<html><h2><u>Git Branch</u></h2>
<h4><pre>
1. A branch is a version of the repository that diverges from the main working project. 
2. It is a feature available in most modern version control systems. 
3. A Git project can have more than one branch. 
4. These branches are pointer to a snapshot of your changes.
5. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug, you spawn a new branch to summarize your changes. 
<mark>So, it is complex to merge the unstable code with the main code base and also facilitates you to clean up your future history before merging with the main branch.</mark>

<h3><u>Git Master Branch</u></h3>
The master branch is a default branch in Git. <u>It is instantiated when first commit made on the project.</u> When you make the first commit, you're given a master
branch to the starting commit point. When you start making a commit, then master branch pointer automatically moves forward. A repository can have only one master
branch.
<mark>Master branch is the branch in which all the changes eventually get merged back. It can be called as an official working verison of your project.</mark>

<h3><u>Some points to remember:-</u></h3>
1. Each task has one separate Branch.
2. After done with the code, merge other branches with master.
3. This concept is useful for parallel development.
4. You can create any number of branches.
5. <mark>Changes are personal to that particular branch.</mark>
6. Default Branch is master.
7. <mark>Files created in workspace will be visible in any of the branch workspace untill you commit. Once you commit, then that files belongs to that particular branch.</mark>
8. When created new Branch, data of the existing branch will be copied to new branch.

<h3><u>Operations on Branches:-</u></h3>

<u>To create Branch - </u>
Example -> $ git branch branch_name

<u>To List Branch - </u>
Example -> $ git branch --list or $ git branch

<u>To delete Branch - </u>
It is a safe operation. In this command, git prevents you from deleting the branch if it has unmerged changes.

Example -> $ git branch -d branch_name

<mark>Note: The git branch d comamnd can be used in two formats. Another format of this command is git branch D.</mark>

<mark>$ git branch -D branch_name </mark> 

<u>Delete a Remote Branch -</u>

You can delete a remote(GitHub) branch from Git desktop application. Below command is used to delete a remote branch.

Example -> $ git push origin -delete branch_name 

<u>To switch Branch - </u>
Git allows you to switch between the branches without making a commit.

Example -> $ git checkout branch_name

<u>Switch from master Branch -</u>

You can switch from master to any other branch available on your repository without making any commit.

Example -> $ git checkout branch_name 

<u>Switch to master branch -</u>

You can switch to the master branch from any other branch with the help of below command.

git branch -m master

<u>To rename Branch - </u>
<mark> $ git branch -m old-branch-name new_branch-name</mark>

<u>Merge Branch -</u>

Git allows you to merge the other branch with the currently active branch. You can merge two branches with the help of git merge command.

$ git merge branch_name
