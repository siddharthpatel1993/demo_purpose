-> A fork is a rough copy of a repository.
-> Forking a repository allows you to freely test and debug with changes without affecting the original project.
-> One of the excessive use of forking is to purpose changes for bug fixing.
-> To resolve an issue for a bug that you found, you can:
   1. Fork the repository.
   2. Make the fix.
   3. Forward a pull request to the project ownner.
-> Fork is not a Git function; it is a feature of Git service like GitHub.

<h3><u>When to use Git Fork -</u></h3>
Generally, forking a repository allows us to experiment on the project without affecting the original project. Following are the reasons for forking the repository:
1. Purpose changes to someone else's project.
2. use an existing project as a starting point.

<h3><u>How to Fork a Repository?</u></h3>
Forking is a safe way to contribute. It allows us to make a rough copy of the project. We can freely experiment on the project. After the final version of the
project, we can create a pull request for merging.

It is a straight-forward process. Steps for forking the repository are as follows:
1. Login to the GitHub account.
2. Find the GitHub repository which you want to fork.
3. Click the Fork button on the upper right side of the repository's page.

<Mark>Note: We can't fork our own repository. Only shared repository can be forked. </Mark>

<h3><u>Fork vs Clone</u></h3>
1. Sometimes people considered the fork as clone command because of their property. Both commands are used to create another copy of the repository. But the significant
   difference is that the fork is used to create a server-side copy, and clone is used to create a local copy of the repository.

2. There is no particular command for forking the repository; instead it is a service provided by third-party service like GitHub. Comparatively, git clone is a command-
   line utility that is used to create a local copy of the project.

3. Generally, people working on the same project clone the repository and the external contributors fork the repository.

4. A pull request can merge the changes made on the fork repository. We can create a pull request to propose changes to the project. Comparatively, changes made on the
   cloned repository can be merged by pushing. We can push the changes to our remote repository.
