<h4><pre>
<h3><u>Git Pull -</u></h3>
1. The pull command is used to access/pull the changes (commits) from a remote repository to the local repository.
2. It updates the local branches with the remote-tracking branches.
3. <u>Remote tracking branches are the branches that have been set up to push and pull from the remote repository.</u>
4. <mark>Generally, it is a collection of the fetch and merge command . ( Git Pull = Git Fetch + Git Merge)</mark>
5. First, it fetches the changes from remote and combine them with the local repository.

Example -> git pull option [repository_URL refspec]

where, option => can be -q(quiet), -v(verbose), -e(edit) and more.

refspec => A ref is referred to commit. For example, head(branches), tags and remote branches. You can check head, tags and remote repository
           in .git/ref directory on your local repository. Refspec specifies and updates the refs.
		   
There are many specific options available for pull command. Let's have a look at some of its usage.

<u>1. Default git pull :-</u>

example -> git pull

<mark>Note: The git pull command is equivalent to git fetch origin head and git merge head. <u>The head is referred to as the ref of current branch.</u></mark>
 
<u>2. Git Pull Remote Branch:-</u>
i. Git allow fetching a particular branch. Fetching a remote branch is a similar process, as mentioned above, in git pull command.
ii. The only difference is we have to copy the URL of the particular branch we want to pull.

example -> git pull remote_branch_URL

<u>3. Git Force Pull:-</u>
i. Git force pull allows for pulling your repository at any cost.
ii. If you have updated any file locally and other team members updated it on the remote. So, when you will fetch the repository, it may create a conflict.
iii. We can say force pull is used for overwriting the files.
iv. If we want to discard all the changes in the local repository, then we can overwrite it by influentially pulling it.

<u>4. Git Pull Origin Master</u>

example -> $ git pull options remote / branchname
	   $ git pull origin master
		   
	   where, origin stands for the repository location where the remote repository situated.
	   Master is considered as the main branch of the project.
		   
Note: You can check the remote location of your repository from command (git remote -v)

<h3><u>Git Pull Request -</u></h3>
1. Pull request is a process for a developer to notify team members that they have completed a feature. 
2. Once their feature branch is ready, the developer files a pull request via their remote server account.
3. Pull request announces all the team members that they need to review the code and merge in into the master branch.  
4. Pull request allows you to announce a change made by you in the branch. 
5. Once a pull request is opened, you are allowed to converse and review the changes made by others. 
6. It allows reviewing commits before merging into the main branch.
7.Pull request is created when you commited a change in the GitHub project, and you want it to be reviewed by other members.
8. You can commit the changes into the new branch or an existing branch.
9. Once you've created a pull request, you can push commits from your branch to add them to your existing pull request.
