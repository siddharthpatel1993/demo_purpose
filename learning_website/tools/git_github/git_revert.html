<html><h2><u>Git Revert</u></h2>
<h4><pre>
1. Git revert command is used to apply revert operation or helps you to undo an existing commit. However, it is not a traditional undo alternative.
2. It doesnot delete any data in this process. Instead, git creates a new commit with the included files reverted to their previous state.
3. So, your version control history moves forward while the state of your file moves backward.
4. If you want to remove something from history then git revert is a wrong chice.

Example -> git revert

<h3><u>Git Revert Options:-</u></h3>
Git revert allows some additional operations like editing, no editing, cleanup and more. Let's understand these options briefly:

<u>a. Commit:-</u> The commit option is used to revert a commit. To revert a commit, we need the commit reference id. The git log command can access it.

Example -> git revert commit-ish

<u>b. Edit:-</u> It is used to edit the commit message before reverting the commit. It is default option in git revert command.

Example -> git revert -e commit-ish

<mark>Note: Above mentioned Commit and Edit have the same functionality.</mark> 

<u>c. parent-number (-m or --mainline):-</u> It is used to revert the merging. Generally, we cannot revert a merge because we do not know which side of the merge should be 
                                      considered as the mainline. We can specify the parent number and allows revert to reverse the change relative to the specified 
                                      parent.

example -> git revert commit_reference -m 1

<u>d. No edit (--no-edit):-</u> This option will not open a text editor. It will directly revert the last commit.

example -> git revert -n commit-ish

<u>e. Cleanup mode(--cleanup=mode):-</u> The cleanup option determines how to strip spaces and comments from the message.

<u>f. No-commit (-n/--no-commit):-</u> Generally, the revert command commits by default. The no-commit option will not automatically commit. In addition,
                               if this option is used, your index does not have to match the HEAD commit.


<h3><u>Git Revert Merge:-</u></h3>
1. A merge in git is a commit that has at least two parents. It brings together multiple lines of development.
2. In a work-flow where features are developed in branches and then merged into a mainline, the merge commits would typically have two parents.

Example -> git revert commit_reference -m 1  

where, -m 1 is used for the first parent as the mainline.

Note:- Merge commit has multiple parents. The revert needs additional information to decide which parent of the merge shall be considered as the mainline.
       In such cases, the parameter -m is used.
