<html><h2><u><center>Git Rm</center></u>
<h4><pre>
1. In Git, the term rm stands for remove. It is used to remove individual files or a collection of files. 
2. The key function of git rm is to remove tracked files from the git index.
3. Additionaly, it can be used to remove files from both the working tree and staging index.
4. The files being removed must be ideal for the branch to remove. No updates to their contents can be staged in the index.
5. Otherwise, the removing process can be complex, and sometimes it will not happen. But it can be done forcefully by -f option.

Example -> $ git rm file_name

Note: a. The above command will remove the file from the Git and the repository. 
      b. The git rm command removes the file not only from the repository but also from the staging area.
      c. If we check the status of the repository, then it will show as deleted.
      d. if we use only the rm command, then it will not permanently delete the file from the git. It can be tracked in the staging area.
	  
Git Rm Cached
1. Sometimes you want to remove files from the Git but keep the files in your local repository.
2. In other words, you do not want to share your file on Git. The cached option is used in this case.
3. It specifies that the removal operation will only act on the staging index, not on the repository.
4. The deleted file can also be re-added on the version control system.

Example -> $ git rm --cached file_name 

Undo the Git Rm Command
1. Execution of git rm command is not permanent; it can be reverted after execution.
2. These changes cannot be persisted until a new commit is made on the repository.
3. We can undo the git rm command. There are several ways to do so. Some of them are as follows -
   a. The most usual and straight-forward way is git reset command. The git reset command will be used as follows:
   
   Example -> $ git reset HEAD or $ git reset --hard

   Note:-> The above command will reset the position of the head. So that, it will get the position of its just previous point.

   b. There is another way to undo the git rm command. We can also fo it by git checkout command. A checkout has the same effect and restores the latest version of a file 
      from HEAD.

   Example -> $ git checkout   

Limits of Git Rm command
1. The git rm is operated only on the current branch.
2. The removing process is only applied to the working directory and staging inde trees.
3. It is not persisted in the repository history untill a new commit is created.
