<html><h2><u>Git Add</u></h2>
<h4><pre>
The git add command is used to add file contents to the Index (Staging Area).This command updates the current content of the working tree to the staging area. It also prepares 
the staged content for the next commit. Every time we add or update any file in our project, it is required to forward updates to the staging area.

The git add command is a core part of Git technology. It typically adds one file at a time, but there some options are available that can add more than one file at once.

<mark>The "index" contains a snapshot of the working tree data. This snapshot will be forwarded for the next commit.</mark>

The git add command can be run many times before making a commit. These all add operations can be put under one commit. The add command adds the files that are specified on 
command line.

<mark>The git add command does not add the .gitignore file by default. In fact, we can ignore the files by this command.</mark>

Let's understand how to add files on Git?

<u><h3>Git add files - </h3></u> 
Git add command is a straight forward command. It adds files to the staging area. We can add single or multiple files at once in the staging area. It will be run as:

<mark>$ git add File_name</mark>  
The above file is added to the git staging area, but yet it cannot be shared on the version control system. A commit operation is needed to share it. <u>Let's understand the 
below scenario.</u>

We have created a file for our newly created repository in NewDirectory. To create a file, use the touch command as follows:

<mark>$ touch newfile.txt</mark>  
And check the status whether it is untracked or not by git status command as follows:

<mark>$ git status  </mark>
The above command will display the untracked files from the repository. These files can be added to our repository. As we know we have created a newfile.txt, so to add this 
file, run the below command:

<mark>$ git add newfile.txt  </mark>

The newfile.txt should be added to our repository. Now, we have to commit it to share on Git.

<u><h3>Git Add All - </h3></u>
We can add more than one files in Git, but we have to run the add command repeatedly. Git facilitates us with a unique option of the add command by which we can add all the 
available files at once. To add all the files from the repository, run the add command with -A option. We can use '.' Instead of -A option. This command will stage all the 
files at a time. It will run as follows:

<mark>$ git add -A </mark>  
Or

<mark>$ git add . </mark> 
The above command will add all the files available in the repository. 

<u><h3>Removing Files from the Staging Area - </h3></u>
<mark>The git add command is also used to remove files from the staging area. If we delete a file from the repository, then it is available to our repository as an untracked 
file. The add command is used to remove it from the staging area. It sounds strange, but Git can do it. </mark> 


<u><h3>Add all New and Updated Files Only - </h3></u>
Git allows us to stage only updated and newly created files at once. We will use the ignore removal option to do so. It will be used as follows:

<mark>$ git add --ignore-removal .  </mark>  

<u><h3>Add all Modified and Deleted Files :-</h3></u>
Git add facilitates us with a variety of options. There is another option that is available in Git, which allows us to stage only the modified and deleted files. It will not 
stage the newly created file. To stage all modified and deleted files only, run the below command:

<mark> $ git add -u </mark> 

<u><h3>Add Files by Wildcard - </h3></u>
Git allows us to add all the same pattern files at once. It is another way to add multiple files together. Suppose I want to add all java files or text files, then we can use 
pattern .java or .txt. To do so, we will run the command as follows:

<mark>$ git add *.java </mark>
  
The above command will stage all the Java files. The same pattern will be applied for the text files.

The next step after adding files is committing to share it on Git.

<u><h3>Git Undo Add -</h3></u>
<mark>We can undo a git add operation. However, it is not a part of git add command, but we can do it through git reset command. </mark>

To undo an add operation, run the below command:

<mark>$ git reset filename </mark>
