<html><h2><u>Git Reset</u></h2>
<h4><pre>
1. Git Reset is a powerful command that is used to undo/reset local changes to the state of a git repo.
2. If we say in terms of Git, then Git is a tool that resets the current state of HEAD to a specified state.
3. Git reset can operate on whole commits objects or at an individual file level.
4. Git uses an index (staging area), HEAD and working directory for creating and reverting commits.
4. The git reset command has three core forms of invocation -
I. Soft
II. Mixed
III. Hard

I. Git Reset Hard:-
1. It will first move the head and update the index with the contents of the last commit.
2. It is most direct, unsafe and frequently used option.
3. The --hard option changes the commit history and ref pointers are updated to the specifed commit.
4. Genreally, the reset hard mode performs below operations:
   a. It will move the HEAD pointer.
   b. It will update the staging area with the content that the HEAD is pointing,
   c. It will update the working directory to match the staging Area.

Example -> git reset --hard

Note: Git reset command can't run on path i.e. it will not run on single file. It will run on whole folder.

II. Git Reset Mixed:-
1. A mixed option is a default option of the git reset command. 
2. Generally, the reset mixed mode performs the below operations:
   a. It will move the head pointer.
   b. It will update the staging area with the content that the HEAD is pointing to.
   c. It will not update the working directory as git hard mode does.

Example -> git reset --mixed or get reset or git reset filename

III. Git Reset Soft (Git Reset Head):-
1. The soft option does not touch the index file or working tree at all, but it resets the HEAD as all options do.
2. It will act as as git amend command.
3. Generally it is used to change the postion of the HEAD.
4. Generally, the reset mixed mode performs the below operations:
   a. It will move the head pointer.
   b. It will not update the staging area with the content that the HEAD is pointing to.
   c. It will not update the working directory as git hard mode does.


Example -> git reset --soft <commit-sha>

Git Reset to Commit

1. Sometimes we need to reset a particular commit, git allows to do so.
2. To reset it, git reset command can be used with any option supported by reset command.
3. It will take the default behavior of a particular comamnd and reset the given commit.
4. The syntax for resetting commit is given below:

$ git reset option commit-sha

These options can be:
a. --soft
b. --mixed
c. --HARD

a. Soft:-
After performing the soft reset on earlier commit, below performance can be expected:-
1. HEAD will be changed or move to the mentioned commit-id from the current one.
2. There is no change in the staging/index area.
3. The is no change in the working area.

Example -> git reset --soft commit_id

a. Mixed:-
After performing the mixed reset on earlier commit, below performance can be expected:-
1. HEAD will be changed or move to the mentioned commit-id from the current one.
2. staging/index area will be get removed.
3. The is no change in the working area.

Example -> git reset --mixed commit_id


a. Hard:-
After performing the hard reset on earlier commit, below performance can be expected:-
1. HEAD will be changed or move to the mentioned commit-id from the current one.
2. staging/index area will be removed.
3. working area will also get removed.

Example -> git reset --hard commit_id
