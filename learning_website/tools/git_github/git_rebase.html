<html><h2><center><u>Git Rebase</u></center>
<h4><pre>
As an alternative to merging, you can rebase the feature branch onto master branch.

$ git checkout feature
$ git rebase master

Note 1. This moves the entire feature branch to begin on the tip of the master branch, effectively incorporating all of the new commits in master.
        But instead of using a merge commit, rebasing re-writes the project history by creating brand new commits for each commit in the original
		branch.
	 2. The major benefit of rebasing is that you can get a much clear project history. First, it eliminates the unnucessary merge commits requited
		by git merge. Second, rebasing also results in a perfectly linear project history.
