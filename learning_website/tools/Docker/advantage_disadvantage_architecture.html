<html><h2><center><u>Advantage, Disadvantage, Architecture and Components of Docker</u></center></h2>
<pre><h4>
<h3><u>Advantage of Docker</u></h3>
-> No pre-allocation of RAM
-> CI Efficiency (Docker enables you to build a Container image and use that same image across every step of the deployment process.)
-> Less cost
-> It is light in weight.
-> It can run on physical H/W, virtual H/W or on cloud.
-> You can re-use the image.
-> It took very less time to create container.

<h3><u>Disadvantage of Docker</u></h3>
-> Docker is not a good solution for application that requires rich GUI.
-> Diffcult to manager large amount of Containers
-> Docker <mark>doesnot provide cross-platform compatibility</mark> means if an application is designed to run in a docker container on windows, then it can't run
   on linux or vice-versa.
-> <mark>Docker is suitable when the development O.S. and testing O.S. are same. If O.S. is different, then we should use VM.</mark>
-> No solution for Data Recovery and Backup.

<h3><u>Docker Architecture </u></h3>
<img src="pic/docker_architecture.JPG" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:800px;height:500px;">

<mark>Containers are Layered file system. It means the steps or command will execute in sequential order as it is written in dockerfile.</mark>

<h3><u>Docker Ecosystem</u></h3>

Docker Ecosystem containes several components (set of s/w or Packages), some of them are following :-

1. <u>Docker Daemon (Docker Server or Docker Engine) :-</u>
-> Docker daemon runs on the host O.S.
-> It is responsible for running containers to manage docker services.
-> Docker Daemon can communicate with other daemons.

2. <u>Docker Clinet :-</u>
-> Docker users can interact with docker daemon through a client (CLI).
-> Docker client uses commands and Rest API to communicate with the docker daemon.
-> When a client runs any server command on the docker client terminal, the client terminal sends these docker commands to the docker daemon.
-> It is possible for the docker client to communicate with more than one daemon.

3. <u>Docker Host :-</u>
-> Docker Host is used to provide an environment to execute and run applications. It contains the docker daemon, images, containers, networks and
   storages.
   
4. <u>Docker Hub (Registry) :-</u>
-> Docker registry manages and stores the docker images.
-> There are two types of registries in the docker -
   i) <u>Public Registry -</u> Public Registry is also called as docker hub.
  ii) <u> Private Registry -</u> It is used to share images within the enterprise.   
   
5. <u>Docker Images :-</u> 
-> Docker Images are read only binary templates used to create docker containers.
-> Or, Single file with all dependencies and configuration required to run a container.
-> There are three ways to get an Image -
   i) Take image from docker hub
  ii) Create image from docker file
 iii) Create image from existing docker Containers.
 
6. <u>Docker Container :-</u>
-> Container holds the entire packages that is needed to run the application.
-> Or, in other words, we can say that, the image is a template and the container is the run time copy of that template.
-> Container is like a Virtual Machine.
-> Images becomes container when they run on docker engine.
-> You can make modifications in containers, but not in the images as it is read only binary templates.
