<html><h2><center>Docker and its comparison to Virtual Machine</center></h2>
<h4><pre>
<h2>What is Docker? </h2>
-> Docker is an open-source Centralised Platform designed to create, deploy and run applications.

-> Docker uses container on the host O.S. to run applications. It allows applications to use the same linux kernel as a system on the host computer,
   rather than creating a whole virtual O.S.
   
-> We can install docker on any O.S. but Docker engine runs natively on linux distribution.

-> Docker written in 'go' language.

-> Docker is a tool that performs O.S. level virtualization, also knowns as Containerization.

-> Before Docker, many users faces the problem that a particular code is running in the developer's system but not in the user's system.

-> So, the main reason to develop docker to help developers to develop applications easily, ship them into containers, and can be deployed anywhere.

-> Docker was first release in March 2013. It is developed by Solomon Hykes and Sebastian Paul.

-> Docker is a set of platform as a service that uses O.S. level virtualization whereas VMware uses Hardware level virtualization.

-> Containers ensure that our application works in any environment like development, test or production.

-> Docker includes components such as Docker client, Docker server, Docker machine, Docker hub, Docker composes etc. 

<h2>Let's understand the difference between Docker containers (Containerization) and Virtual Machine (O.S. level of 
Virtualization):-</h2>

<u>Virtual Machine -</u>
A Virtual Machine is a software that allows us to install and use other operating systems (Windows, Linux, and Debian) simultaneously on our machine.
The operating system in which virtual application runs are called virtualized operating systems. These virtualized operating systems can run programs 
and performs tasks that we perform in a real operating system.

The following image shows the standard and traditional architecture of virtualization.

1. The server is the physical server that is used to to host multiple virtual machines.
2. The Host OS is the base machine such as Linux or Windows.
3. The Hypervisor is either VMWare server and workstation, Oracle VM VirtualBox or Microsoft Virtual PC that is used to host virtual machines.
4. You would then install multiple operating systems as virtual machines on top of the existing hypervisor as Guest OS.
5. You would the host your applications on top of each Guest OS.

<u>Docker Containers -</u>
Docker Containers are lightweight alternatives of the virtual machine. It allows developers to package up the application with all its libraries and
dependencies, and ship it as a single package. The advantage of using docker container is that you don't need to allocate any RAM and disk space for
the applications. It automatically generates storage and space according to the application requirement.

The following image shows the new generation of virtualization that is enabled via Dockers. Let's have a look at the various layers.

<img src="pic/containerization.JPG" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:500px;height:300px;">

1. The server is the physical server that is used to host multiple virtual machines. So this layer remains the same.
2. The Host OS is the base machine such as Linux or Windows. So this layer remains the same.
3. Now comes the new generation which is the Docker engine. This is used to run the operating system which earlier used to be virtual machines  now 
   as Docker containers.
4. All of the Apps now run as Docker containers.

The clear advantage is in this architecture is that you don't need to have extra hardware for Guest OS. Everything works as Docker containers. 

While both virtual machines and containers enable application portability, containers are significantly lighter and thus, more portable. The main reason 
is that, unlike VMs, containers no longer include an OS and its associated kernel (i.e. the part of OS that gets loaded first upon boot up and eventually
takes charge of memory, disk, process and task management). In containerization, a single kernel resides in the host OS and is simply shared among containers.
All that's housed in a container is the applicaton code and its dependencies. 

The absence of a kernel benefits containers in several ways.

1. Container sizes can be as small as 10 megabytes, whereas virtual machines can easily exceed 10 gigabytes (a windows server 2016 VM, for instance, could
   be about 32 GB).

2. The memory requirments for containers are significantly lower than those of virtual machines. And it's not just about the size of a memory VMs consume, which
   must be comparatively larger to accomodate a kernel, to begin with. 
	    Rather, it's also how early in their lifecycle VMs consume those memory resources. Virtual Machines grab the amount of memory that's been allocated
   for them upon boot up, regardless of whether they alreday need it or not.

3. No kernel means faster boot times. A typical virtual machine would require a few minutes to boot due to its kernel, while some containers would require only
   less than a second.
