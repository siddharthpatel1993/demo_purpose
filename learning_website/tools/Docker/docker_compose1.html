<h3><u>What is Docker Compose?</u></h3>
<h4><pre>
1. Docker compose is a tool built by docker to ease the task to creating and configring multiple containers in a development environment, counter-part of docker-compose for 
   production environment is Docker Swarm. 
2. Docker compose takes as input a YAML configuration file and creates the resources (image, containers, networks, volumes etc) by communicating with the docker daemon through 
   docker API.
3. It is important to note that Docker compose doesn't explicitly build Docker images. The job of building images is done by Docker through the Dockerfile.

<h3><u>The Docker-compose.yml file</u></h3>
1. It won't be awefully worng to say that a Docker compose file is to Docker compose, what a Dockerfile is to Docker.

2. Inside the Docker compose file, lies all the instructions that Docker compose follows when managing the containers. Here, you define the services which end up being
   containers. You also define the networks and volumes that the services depend on. 

3. You can have services for the backend, frontend, database and message queues in the web app. These services will need specific dependencies. Dependencies such as the 
network, ports, storage for optimal operation. Everything needed for the entire application will be defined in the Docker Compose file. 
   
4. There'll be a lot of key-value pairings or directives in your file. The top-level ones are:
   I. Version
  II. Services
 III. Network
  IV. Volumes
   
However, we usually mention only the version and services, as you can define the other two in services directive.

<u>I. Version :-</u>
1. When writing your file, you'll define the version first. As at the time of the writing, Docker Compose only has versions 1,2 and 3.

2. You can specify the version to use for Docker compose in the file as seen below:
   - Version: "3"
   - Version: "2.4"
   - Version: "1.0"

<u>II. Services:-</u>
The service key is the most important key in a Docker Compose file. Here, you specify the containers you want to create. There are lot of options and tons of combinations for
configuring containers in this section of the file. These are some options you can denfine under the services key:

a. Image
b. Container_name
c. Restart
d. Depends_on
e. Environment
f. Ports
g. Volumes
h. Networks
i. Entrypoint

<u>a. Images</u>
1. This option defines what image as service uses. It uses the same convention as you use when pulling an image from Dockerhub in a Dockerfile.

Example-> image: postgres:latest

2. However, there is no restriction to using Dockerhub files alone. You can also build images from your machine through your Docker Compose file, using a Dockerfile.
   You can use the "build", "context" and "dockerfile" directives to do this.

Example -> build:
		context: .
		dockerfile: Dockerfile
			 
3. "Context" should contain the path to the directory with the Dockerfile. Then "dockerfile" contains the name of the Dockerfile to be used. It is conventional to always
   to always name your Dockerfiles as "Dockerfile", but this gives an opportunity to use something different.
   
<u>b. Container_name:</u>
1. Docker assigns random names to containers. But you may have desire to have customized names for the containers. 
2. With the "container_name" key, you can give specific names to the containers, instead of Dockers randomly generated names.

Example -> container_name: pythonapptest

3. However, thers is one thing you should be careful about, don't give the same name to multiple services. Container name have to be unique; doing so will cause the services 
to fail.

<u>c. Restart</u>
1. There are many reasons for the container to fail, so the restart key tells the container to wake or not.
2. You can different options like no, always, on-failure and unless-stopped. These options imply that a container will never restart, will always restart, only restart on 
failure or only when stopped.

Example -> restart: always

<u>d. Depends_on:</u>
1. Services run in isolation. But practically, services can't do much in isolation. There needs to be dependency on other services.
2. For example, the backend service of the web app will depend on databases, caching services etc.
3. At the "depends_on" key, you can add the dependencies.

Example ->       depends_on:
			- db
4. Doing this means that Docker compose will start those services before the current one. However, it doesn't ensure that those services are ready to use. The only guarantee 
is that the containers will start.
   
<u>e. Environment:</u>
1. Applications depend on certain variables. For security and ease of use, you extract them from the code and set them as environment variables. 
2. Example of such variables are API keys, passwords, and so on.
3. This key only works if there is no "build" directive in that service. Hence, create the image beforehand.

Example -> environment:
		API-KEY: 'the-api-key'
		CONFIG: 'development'
		SESSION_SECRET: 'the-secret'
				
4. If you intend to use the "build" directive regardless, you'll need to define the environment variables in an "args" directive. 
5. The "args" directive is a sub-directive of "build".

Example -> build:
		context: .
		args:
			api-key: 'the-api-key'
			config: 'development'
			session_secret: 'the-secret'

<u>f. Ports:</u>
1. No container works in isolation despite running separately from the others. To provide a link to communicate with the "outside world", you need to map ports.
2. You map the Docker containers's port to the actual host port.
3. From Docker, you may have come across the "-p" argument that is used to map ports. The port directive works similar to the "-p" argument.

Example -> ports:
		- "5000:8000"
				
<u>g. Volumes:</u>
1. Docker containers have no means of storing data persistently, so they lose data when they start.
2. With Volumes, you can work around this. Volumes makes it possible to create a persistent data storage. 
3. It does this by mounting a directory from the docker host into the docker container's directory.

Example -> volumes:
		- host-dir:/test/directory
				
<u>h. Network:</u>
1. Networks can also be created in services. With the networks key, you can setup the networking for individual services.
2. Here, you can setup the driver the network uses, if it allows IPv6, etc.

Example -> networks:
		- default
				
<u>i. Entrypoint:</u>
1. When you start a container, you often must run certain commands. For example, if the service is web applicaiton, you must start the server.
2. The entrypoint key lets you do this. Entrypoint works like ENTRYPOINT in Dockerfile.
3. The only difference in this case is that whatever you define here overrides the ENTRYPOINT configurations in the dockerfile.

Example -> entrypoint: flask run
