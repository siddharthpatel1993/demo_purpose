<h3><u>Difference between docker attach and docker exec -</u></h3>
Docker exec creates a new process in the container's environment while docker attach just connect the standard Input/Output of the main process inside
the container to corresponding standard input/output error of current terminal.

Docker exec is specifically for running new things in a alreday started container, be it a shell or some other process.

-> docker exec -it techserver /bin/bash
-> docker attach dockername or container_id

<h3><u>Difference between expose and publish a docker -</u></h3>
Basically you have four options :-
1. Neither specify expose nor -p -
   If you specify neither expose nor -p, the service in the container will only be accessible from inside the container.

2. Only specify expose
   If you expose a port, the service in the container is not accessible from outside docker, but from inside other docker containers, so this is 
   good for inter-container communication.

3. Specify expose and -p
   If you expose and publish a port, the service in the container is accessible from anywhere, even outside the docker.


4. Only specify publish  
   If you do publish but do not expose, docker does an implicit expose. This is because, if a port is open to the public, it is automatically also
   open to the other docker containers. Hence '-p' includes expose.
