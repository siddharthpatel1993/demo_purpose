<html><h2><u>Hypervisor</u></h2>
<h4><pre>
Hypervisor is a piece of software or firmware that creates and run Virtual Machines. A Hypervisor is sometimes also called a Virtual Machine Manager (VMM).

<h3><u>Types of Hypervisor -</u></h3>
1. Type - 1 Hypervisor (Bare Metal or Native Hypervisor).
2. Type - 2 Hypervisor (Hosted Hypervisor). 

<h3><u>Type - 1 Hypervisor</u></h3>
Also called Bare Metal Hypervisor. Type - 1 Hypervisor runs directly on the system hardware (<mark>It is fireware</mark>). A guest O.S. runs on another level 
above the Hypervisor.

-> VMware ESXi is a Type -1 Hypervisor that runs on the host server hardware without an underlying O.S.
-> Type - 1 Hypervisor act as their own operating system.

<mark>ESXi provides a virtualization layer that abstracts the CPU, storage, memory and networking resources of the physical host into multiple Virtual Machine.</mark>

It is generally used at enterprise level.

<h3><u>Type - 2 Hypervisor(Hosted Type)</u></h3>
Hypervisor that runs within a Conventional O.S. environment, and the host O.S. provides.

-> Example of Type - 2 Hypervisor are VMware workstation, Oracle VirtualBox and Microsoft Virtual PC.
-> It doesn't not have direct access to the host hardware & resources.

It is used for testing or learning.
