<html><h2><u><center>Docker ONBUILD</u></center>
<h4><pre>
Docker ONBUILD command instruction is used to specify the commands that runs when the new docker image is used as a base image for another image (child image).We can use this 
ONBUILD instruction where you need a static base image with a dynamic config value that changes in a new image or we can use in a situationwhere a new image is depend on 
previous image.

Assume that we create a dockerfile with various instruction and specifying ONBUILD instructions at the end of the dockerfile. When we build a image with current dockerfile 
using "docker build" command, this will create a new docker image but ONBUILD instruction will not be applied into the current docker image. This will be applied only 
when we use the newly created image as a base image in another dockerfile.

Lets take an example that we want to create a new image which has all prerequisite ready for running multiple applications or scripts. Finally we will use the "prerequisite" 
image as a base image to run pur applications and script.

$ cat dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
