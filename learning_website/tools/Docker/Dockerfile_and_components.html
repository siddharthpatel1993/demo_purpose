<html><h2><center><u>Dockerfile and it's components</u></center></h2>
<pre><h4>
<h2><u>Dockerfile -</u></h2>
-> Dockerfile is basically a text file which contains a series of commands or instructions.
-> These instructions are executed in the order in which they are written.
-> Execution of these instructions takes place on a base image.
-> On building the Dockerfile, the successive actions form a new image from the base parent image.
-> Automation of Docker image creation.

<h2><u>Dockerfile Commands -</u></h2>
<u>FROM</u> -> 
For base image. This command must be on top of the dockerfile.

<u>RUN</u> -> 
To execute commands, it will create a layer in image.

<u>MAINTAINER</u> -> 
Author/ Owner/ Description

<u>COPY</u> -> 
1. It lets you copy files from local system (docker VM) to Docker image itself. 
2. We need to provide source, destination (we can't download files from internet and any remote repo). [Note 1]
			  
<u>ADD</u> -> 
1. Simlar to COPY but, it provides a feature to download files from internet i.e. you can use URL instead of a local file/ directory, and also extract tar file from the source directly into the destination. [Note 1]

<u>EXPOSE</u> -> 
1. The EXPOSE instruction expose a port, the protocol can be UDP or TCP associated with the indicated port, default is TCP with no specification. 
2. The EXPOSE won't be able to map the ports on the host machine. 
3. Regardless of the EXPOSE settings, EXPOSE port can be override using -p flag while staring the container.
4. To expose ports such as 8080 for tomcat, port 80 for nginx etc.

<u>CMD</u> ->
1. The CMD command specifices the instruction that is to be executed when a Docker container starts.
2. The main puprose of the CMD command is to launch the software required in a container. For example, the user may need to run an executable .exe file or a BASH terminal as soon as the container starts,
   the CMD command can be used to handle such requests.
3. CMD can be configured in two forms:
	a. Exec Form -
		CMD ["executable", "param1", "param2"]
        b. Shell Form -
                 CMD command param1 param2
4. There can be only one CMD instructiom in Dockerfile. If you list more than one CMD instructions, then only the last CMD will take effect.  

<u>ENTRYPOINT</u> -> 
1. Similar to CMD, but has higher priority over CMD, first commands will be executed by ENTRYPOINT only. The ENTRYPOINT instruction make your container run as an executable.
2. ENTRYPOINT can be configured in two forms:
	a. Exec Form - 
		ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"]
        b. Shell Form -
                 ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2

<u>ENV</u> - 
1. The ENV instruction in Dockerfile sets the environmental variables for your container when you start. 
2. The default value can be overridden by passing --env <key>=<value> when you start the container.

<u>WORKDIR</u> - 
1. The WORKDIR directive in dockerfile defines the working directory for the rest of the instructions in the Dockerfile. 
2. The WORKDIR instruction won't create a new layer in the image but will add metadata to the image config. 
3. If the WORKDIR doesn't exist, it will be created even if it's not used in any subsequent Dockerfile instruction. 
4. You can have multiple WORKDIR in same Dockerfile. 
5. If a relative path is provided, it will be relative to the previous WORKDIR instruction. 
6. If no WORKDIR is specified in the Dockerfile then the default path is /. 
7. The WORKDIR instruction can resolve environment variables previously set in Dockerfile using ENV.  

<u>ONBUILD</u> - 
1. Docker ONBUILD command instruction is used to specify the commands that runs when the new docker image is used as a base image for another image (child image).
2. We can use this ONBUILD instruction where you need a static base image with a dynamic config value that changes in a new image or we can use in a situation where a new image is depend on previous image. 

<u>ARG</u> -
1. The ARG directive in Dockerfile defines the parameter name and defines its default value. 
2. This default value can be overridden by the --build-arg parameter_name=value in the build command docker build.
3. The build parameters have the same effect as ENV, which is to set the environment variables.
4. The difference is that the environemt variables of the build environemt set by ARG will not exist in the future when the container is running.
5. But doesn't use ARG to save passwords and the like, because docker history can still see the values.

<u>VOLUME</u> -
1. A volume is a persistent data stored in /var/lib/docker/volumes/... location.
2. There are three way you can create volumes = -
   a. It can be created from dockerfile.
   b. It can created at run time means while creating the container from "docker run" command.
   c. And the last option is from "docker volume create". 

<u>LABEL</u> -
1. You can add lables to your image to help organize images by project, record licensing information, to aid in automation, or for the other reasons.
2. For each label, add a line beginning with LABEL and with one or more key-value pairs.
3. The LABEL instruction adds metadata to an image.

<u>USER</u>-
1. USER is the identity of the commands such as RUN, CMD and ENTRYPOINT.
2. USER helps you switch to the specified user. This user must be pre-established, otherwise it cannot be switched.

Note:
1. COPY and ADD are both Dockerfile instructions that serve similar purposes. They let you copy files from specific location into a Docker image.
2. You can name your stages, by adding an AS to the FROM instruction. By default, the stages are not named, and you can refer to them by their integer number , starting with 0 
   for the first FROM instruction. You are not limited to copying from stages you created earlier in your Dockerfile, you can use the COPY --from instruction to copy from a 
   separate image, either using the local image name, a tag available locally or on a Docker registry.
3. If you mention two entrypoint in the dockerfile, the second one will get executed and the first one will get ignored.
4. If an image has an entrypoint and if you pass an argument in it, while running container it won't override the existing ENTRYPOINT you should use --entrypoint flag when running container.
5. Do not confuse RUN with CMD, RUN actually runs a command and commits the result. CMD does not execute anything at build time, but specifies the intended command for the image.
