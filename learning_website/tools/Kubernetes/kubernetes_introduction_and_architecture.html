<h4><pre>
-> Kubernetes is an open-source container management tool which automates container deployment, container scaling and load balancing.
-> It schedules, runs and manages isolated containers which are running on virtual/physical/cloud machines.
-> All top cloud providers support Kubernetes.
-> Numeronym of Kubernetes is K8s. Famous example is i18n (internationalization).
-> Project Seven is the reason why k8s is having seven sticks in its logo.
-> Monolithic(Mono means single and lithic means stone) Application/Architecture is where the code of all the feature about the application written together and deployed on the same server.  
-> Microservice got introduced to eliminate the Monolithic Application.
<h3><u>History</u></h3>
-> Google developed an internal system called 'Borg' (later named as Omega) to deploy and manage thousands Google application and services on their cluster. 
-> In 2014, Google introduced Kubernetes an open source platform written in "Golang' and later donated to CNCF.

<h3><u>Online Platform for K8s</u></h3>
-> Kubernetes playground
-> Play with K8s
-> Play with Kubernetes Classroom

<h3><u>Cloud Based K8s Services</u></h3>
-> GKE (Google Kubernetes Services)
-> AKS (Azure Kubernetes Services)
-> Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Services)

<h3><u>Kubernetes Installation Tool</u></h3>
-> Minicube
-> Kubeadm

<h3><u>Problems with scaling up the containers</u></h3>
-> Containers cannot communicate with each other.
-> Auto-scaling and Load Balancing was not possible.
-> Containers had to be managed carefully.

<h3><u>Features of Kubernetes</u></h3>
-> Orchestration (clustering of any no. of containers running on different n/w)
-> Auto-scaling (Vertical and Horizontal)
-> Auto-Healing
-> Load Balancing
-> Platform Independent (cloud/virtual/physical)
-> Fault Tolerance (Node/POD failure)
-> Rollback (going back to previous version)
-> Health Monitoring of containers
-> Batch Execution (one time, sequential, parallel)

<h3><u>Architecture of Kubernetes</u></h3>

<img src="pic/kubernetes_architecture.JPG" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:1000px;height:700px;">

-> We create manifest (.yml).
-> Apply this to cluster (to master) to bring into desired state.
-> Pod runs in node, which is controlled by master.
-> To make the master node, you need minimum 2 vCPU and 4 GB RAM.
-> POD is smallest unit in K8s.
-> API server directly does not contact the container, it is done through POD.
-> Container doesn't have own IP address, POD will have the IP address.
-> There would be generally only one container in every POD, but POD can contain more than one container.
-> POD can't restart, once it fails. It will be destroyed. On place of it new POD will get created.
-> This is why only one container is preferred in every POD.
-> Etcd is not a component of K8s, but without it K8s will not work.   

<u>Role of Master Node</u>
-> Kubernetes cluster contains containers running on Bare Metal/ VM instances/ Cloud instances/ all mix.
-> Kubernetes designates one or more of these nodes as master and all other as workers.
-> The master is now going to run set of K8s processes. These processes will ensure smooth functioning of cluster. These processes are called "Control Plane".
-> Can be multi-master for high availability.
-> Master runs control plane to run cluster smoothly. 

<u>Components of Control Plane(Master)</u>
1. Kube-apiserver
2. etcd (not part of k8s, but without it k8s will not work)
3. Kube-scheduler
4. Controller-Manager

<u>1. Kube-apiserver</u>
-> This api-server interacts directly with user (i.e. we apply yml or json manifest to kube-apiserver).
-> This kube-apiserver is meant to scale automatically as per load.
-> Kube-apiserver is front-end of control-plane.

<u>2. etcd</u>
-> Stores metadata and status of cluster.
-> etcd is consistent and high-available store (key-value store).
-> Source of touch for cluster state (info about state of cluster).
-> etcd has following features :-
   a. Fully Replicated: The entire state is available on every node in the cluster.
   b. Secure: Implements automatic TLS with optional client-certificate authentication.
   c. Fast - Benchmarked at 10,000 writes per second.

<u>3. Kube-scheduler</u>
-> When users make request for the creation and management of Pods, kube-scheduler is going to take action on these requests.
-> Handles Pod creation and management.
-> Kube-scheduler match/assign any node to create and run pods.
-> A scheduler watches for newly created pods that have no node assigned. For every Pod that the scheduler discovers, the scheduler becomes responsible for finding best node 
   for the pod to run on.
-> Scheduler gets the information for hardware configuration from configuration files and schedules the Pods on nodes accordingly.

<u>4. Control Manager</u>
-> Make sure actual state of cluster matches to desired state.
-> Two possible choices for control manager -
   - If K8s on cloud, then it will be cloud-control manager.
   - If k8s on non-cloud, then it will be kube-controller manager.
-> Components on master that runs controller
   - Node Controller:-> For checking the cloud provider to determine if a node has been detected in the cloud after it stops responding.
   - Route Controller:-> Responsible for setting up network, routes on your cloud.
   - Service Controller:-> Responsible for load balancers on your cloud against services of type load balancer.
   - Volume Controller:-> For creating, attaching and mounting volumes and interacting with the cloud provider to orchestrate volume.   
   
<u>Nodes (kubelet and container engine)</u>
-> Node is going to run 3 important piece of software and processes.

<u>1. kubelet</u>
-> Agent running on the node.
-> Listens to Kubernetes master (eg:- pod creation request)
-> Use port 10255
-> Send success/fail reports to master

<u>2. Container Engine (Eg - Docker, Rocket)</u>
-> Works with kubelet
-> Pulling images
-> Start/stop containers
-> Exposing containers on ports specified in manifest.

<u>3. Kube-proxy</u>
-> Assign IP to each Pod.
-> It is required to assign IP address to pods (dynamic).
-> Kube-proxy runs on each node and this make sure that each pod will get its own unique IP address.
-> These three components collectively consist 'node'.

<u>4. POD</u>
-> Smallest unit in Kubernetes.
-> Pod is group of one or more containers that are deployed together on the same host.
-> A cluster is group of nodes.
-> A cluster has at least one worker node and one master node.
-> In Kubernetes, the control unit is the Pod, not containers.
-> Consist of one or more tightly coupled containers.
-> Pod runs on node, which is control by master.
-> Kubernetes only knows about Pods (does not not know about individual container) 
-> Cannot start containers without a Pod.
-> One Pod usually contains one container.

<h3><u>Multi-container Pods</u></h3>
-> Share access to memory space.
-> Connect to each other using localhost (container port).
-> Share access to the same volume.
-> Containers within pod are deployed in an all-or-nothing manner.
-> Entire pod is hosted on the same node (scheduler will decide about which node)

<u>POD Limitations</u>
-> No auto-healing or auto-scaling by default. Need to install plugins for higher level Kubernetes objects.
-> Pod crashes

<u>Higher Level Kubernetes Objects</u>
-> Replication Set - scaling and healing
-> Deployment - Versioning and Rollback
-> Service - Static (non-ephemeral) IP and networking
-> Volume - Non-ephemeral storage

<u>Important</u>
kubectl -> single cloud
kubeadm -> On premise
kubefed -> Federated
