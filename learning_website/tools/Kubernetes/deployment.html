-> Replication Controller and Replica Set is not able to do update and rollback apps in the cluster.
-> A deployment object act as a supervisor for pods, giving you fine-grained control over how and when a new pod is rolled out, updated or roll back to a previous state.
-> When using deployment object, we first define the state of the app, then K8s cluster schedules mentioned app instance onto specific individual nodes.
-> A deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and Replica Set.
-> K8s then monitors, if the node hosting an instance goes down or pod is deleted the deployment controller replaces it.
-> This provides a self-healing mechanism to address machine failure or maintenance.
    
The following are typical use cases of Deployments - 
1. Create a deployment to Rollout a RelicaSet - The ReplicaSet creates pods in the background. Check the status of the Rollout to see if it succeeds or not.
2. Declare the new state of the Pods -> By updating the PodTemplateSpec of the deployment, a new ReplicaSet is created and the Deployment manages moving the pod from
   the old ReplicaSet to the new one at the controlled rate. Each new ReplicaSet updates the revision of the Deployment.
3. Rollback to an earlier Deployment Revision - If the current state of the Deployment is not stable. Each rollback updates the revision of the Deployment.
4. Scale up the Deployment to facilitates more load.
5. Pause the Deployment to apply multiple fixes to its PodTemplateSpec and then resume it to start a new Rollout.
6. Cleanup older ReplicaSets that you don't need anymore. 

No of pods will remain the same in v2 after roll back. Even though it has more pods in the next version.
Previous relica set is never get deleted by default. It will be stored and recoverable. Only pods get deleted and not recoverable.
Recently created pod would always be deleted first.  

-> If there are problems in the deployment, Kubernetes will automatically roll back to the previous version, however you can also explicitly roll back to a specific revision,
   as in our case to Revision 1 (the original Pod version)
-> You can rollback to a specific version by specifying it with --to-revision.
For eg - kubectl rollout undo deploy/mydeployments --to-revision=2

Note:-> That the name of the RelicaSet is always formatted as [Deployment-name]-[Random String]
cmd -> kubectl get deploy

When you inspect the deployments in your cluster, the following fields are displayed.
NAME -> List the names of the deployments in the namespace.
READY -> Display how many replicas of the application are available to your users. If follows the pattern ready/desired.
UP-TO-DATE -> Display the number of replicas that have been updated to achieve the desired state.
AVAILABLE -> Displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.
AGE -> Display the amount of time that the application has been running.

Failed Deployment
You deployment may get stuck trying to deploy its newest ReplicaSet without ever completing. This can occur due to some of the following factors.
1. Insufficient Quota
2. Readiness probe failures
3. Image pull errors
4. Insufficient permission
5. Limit Ranges
6. Application runtime misconfiguration
