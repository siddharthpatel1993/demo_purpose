<u>Replica Set</u>
-> Replica Set is a next generation replication controller.
-> The replication controller only supports equality-based selector whereas the replica set supports equality-based and set-based selectors i.e. filtering according to set of values.
-> Replica set rather than the replication controller is used by other objects like deployment.
