<pre><h4>
-> We have replicasets, Daemonsets, statefulsets and deployments they all share one common property: they ensure that their pods are always running.
-> If a pod fails, the controller restarts it or reschedules it to another node to make sure the application the pod is hosting keeps running.

Use cases:
1. Take backup of DB
2. Helm charts uses jobs
3. Running Batch processes
4. Run a task at a schedule internal
5. Log rotation

kubectl apply -f job.yml
watch !! or watch kubectl get pods
Job does not get deleted by itself, we have to delete it.
kubectl delete -f job.yml

The CronJob Pattern

-> If we have multiple nodes hosting the application for high availability, which nodes handles cron?
-> What happens if multiple identical jobs run simultaneously? 

apiVersion: batch/v1beta1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
 name: bhupi
spec:
 schedule: "* * * * *"

         containers:
         - image: ubuntu
           name: bhupi
           command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "echo Technical-Guftgu; sleep 5"]
         restartPolicy: Never

watch kubectl get pods
=================

Init Containers

-> Init containers are specialized containers that run before app containers in a pod.
-> Init containers always run to completion.
-> If a pod's init container fails, Kubernetes repeatedly restarts the pod until the init container succeeds.
-> Init container do not support readiness probe.

Use Cases
-> Seeding a database.
-> Delaying the application launch until the dependencies are ready.
-> Clone a git repository into a volume.
-> Generate configuration file dynamically.

For init container check the video.

Pod Life Cycle

Pending -> Running -> Succeeded -> Failed -> Completed -> Unknown

-> The phase of a pod is a simple, high-level summary of where the pod is in its lifecycle.

Pending 
-> The pod has been accepted by the k8s system, but its not running.
-> One or more of the container images is still downloading.
-> If the pod cannot be scheduled because of resource constraints.

Running
-> The pod has been bound to a node.
-> All of the containers have been created.
-> Atleast one container is still running or is in the process of starting or restarting.

Succeeded
-> All containers in the pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted.

Failed
-> All containers in the pod have terminated and atleast one container has terminated in failure.
-> The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by the system. 

Completed
-> The pod has run to completion as there is noting to keep it running.
eg - Completed jobs

Unknown
-> State of the pod could not be obtained.
-> Typically due to an error in network or communicating with the host of the pod. 

Pod Conditions

-> A pod has a pod status, which has an array of pod conditions through which the pod has or has not passed.
-> Using 'kubectl describe pod PODNAME' you can get condition of a pod.

These are the possible types -
PodSecheduled :- The pod has been scheduled to a node.
Ready :- The pod is able to serve request and will be added to the load balancing pools of all matching services.
Initialized :- All init containers have started successfully. 
Unscheduled :- The scheduler cannot schedule the pod right now, for eg - due to lacking of resources or other constraints.
ContainerReady :- All containers in the pod are ready.
