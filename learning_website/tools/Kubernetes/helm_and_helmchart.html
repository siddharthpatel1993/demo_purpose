<html><u><center><h2>Helm (Packaging Manager)and Helm Chart</h2></center></u>
<pre><h4>
-> In linux, yum (RedHat) and apt (ubuntu) are common packing manager. It actually do Automated installation, version management, dependency management, removing packages and its dependencies.
-> Introduced first time in 2015.
-> Helm helps you manage k8s applications with helm charts which helps you define, install and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.
-> Helm is the k8s equivalent of yum or apt.
-> Helm is now an official k8s project and is part of CNCF.
-> The main building block of Helm based deployments are Helm charts, these charts describe a configurable set of dynamically generated k8s resources.
-> The chart can either be stored locally or fetched from remote chart repositories.       

Why use helm?
-> Writing and maintaining Kubernetes YAML manifest for all the required Kubernetes objects can be a time consuming and tedious task. For the simplest of deployments, you would
   need atleast 3 YAML manifest with duplicated and hardcoded values.
-> Helm simplifies the process and create a single package that can be advertised to you cluster.
-> Helm3 was released in Nov, 2019.
-> Helm k8s automatically maintains a database of all versions of your releases. So, whenever something goes wrong during deployment, rolling back to the previous version is just one command away.

Some keyword to understand HELM.

CHART -> A chart is the helm package. It contains all of the resource definitions necessary to run an application, tool or service inside of a Kubernetes cluster. Think of it like the Kubernetes 
         equipment of a Homebrew formula, apt, yum or RPM file.
                   OR
	  -> Helm charts are simply k8s YAML manifests combined into a single package that can be advertised to your k8s cluster.

RELEASE -> A release is an instance of a chart running in a k8s cluster. One chart can often be installed many times into the same cluster and each time it is installed, a new release is created.
           Consider a MySQL chart, if you can install that chart twice, each one will have its own release, which will in turn have its own release name.
____________________
|Revision |Request |	   
|_________|_______________________|
|_____1___|___Installed Chart_____|
|_____2__ |_______Upgrade to 1.1_|

-> Helm keep tracks of all chart execution (Install, upgrade and rollback)

REPOSITORY
-> Location where packaged charts can be stored and shared.

HELM-3 Architecture

-> HELM-3 is a single-service architecture. One executable is responsible for implementing HELM. There is no client-server split, nor is the core processing logic distributed among components.
-> Implementation of HELM-3 is a single command line, client with no in-cluster server or controller. This tool exposes command line operations and unilaterally handles the package management process.
->  HELM-2 was client-server, where server was called as tiller. Why tiller was used in HELM2 because, Roll Based Access Control (RBAC) was absent there in helm2.  

===========================================
Helm Commands

-> 'helm repo': Interact with charts repository. Helm3 no longer ships with a default chart repository.
-> helm repo list
-> helm repo add name url
-> helm repo remove name
-> 'helm search': for finding charts
   for eg:- helm search repo chart
-> helm show: Information about a chart
   for eg:- helm show values|chart|readme|all chartname
-> helm install: Install a package
   for eg:- helm install release_name chart_name
-> Wait untill all subjects are ready
   for eg:- helm install mychart stable/tomcat --wait --timeout 10s
-> helm create: create a new chart with given name
   for eg: helm create helloworld
