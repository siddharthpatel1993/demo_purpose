<html><u><center><h2>Configmap and Secrets</h2></center></u>
<pre><h4>
-> While performing application deployments on K8s cluster, sometimes we need to change the application configuration file depending on environments like Dev, QA, Stage or Prod.
-> Changing this application configuration file means we need to change source code, commit the change, creating a new image and then go through the complete deployment process.
-> Hence these configurations should be decoupled from image content in order to keep containerized application portable.
-> This is where Kubernetes Configmap comes handy. It allows us to handle configuration files much more efficiently.  
-> Configmaps are useful for storing and sharing non-sensitive, unencrypted configuration information (use secrets otherwise)
-> Configmap can be used to store fine-grained information like individual properties or entire configfiles.
-> Configmap are not intended to act as a replacement for a properties files.  
-> Configmap and Secrets can be accessed in following ways :-
   1. As environment variable
   2. As volume in the Pod

kubectl create configmap mapname --from-file=file_to_read

Secrets

-> You don't want sensitive information such as a database password or an API key kept around in clear text.
-> Secrets provide you with a mechanism to use such information in a safe and reliable way with the following properties :-
   - Secrets are namespaced objects, that is exist in the context of namespace.
   - You can access them via a volume or an environment variable from a container running in a Pod.
-> The secret data on nodes is stored in tmfs volumes (tmpfs is a file system which keeps all files in Virtual Memory. Everything in tmfs is temporary in the service that no files
   will be created on your hard drive.
-> A per secret size limit of 1 MB exist.
-> The API server stores secrets as plain text in etcd.
-> Secrets can be created either from a text file or from a yaml file.
