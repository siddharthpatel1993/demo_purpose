<h4><pre>
<h3><u>Kubernetes Objects</u></h3> 
-> Kubernetes uses objects to represent the state of your cluster.
-> What containerized applications are running (and on which node).
-> The policies around how those applications behave, such as restart policies, upgrades and fault tolerance.
-> Once you create the object, the Kubernetes system will constantly work to ensure that object exist and maintains cluster's desired state.
-> Every Kubernetes object includes two nested fields that govern the object config, the object spec and the object status.
-> The spec, which we provide, describes your desired state for the object, the characteristics that you want the object to have.
-> The status describes the actual state of the object and is supplied and updated by the Kubernetes system.
-> All objects are identified by a unique name and UID.
-> It represents as JSON or YAML files.
-> You create these and then push them to the Kubernetes API with kubectl.
-> The basic Kubernetes objects include -
   1. POD
   2. Service
   3. Volume
   4. Namespace
   5. Replicasets
   6. Secrets
   7. ConfigMaps
   8. Deployments
   9. Jobs
   10. Daemonsets

<h3><u>Relationship between these Objects</u></h3>    
-> Pod manages containers
-> Replicaset manages pods
-> Services expose pod processes to the outside world
-> Configmaps and secrets helps you config pods.

<h3><u>State of the Object</u></h3> 
1. Replicas (2/2)
2. Image (Tomcat/ubuntu)
3. Name
4. Port
5. Volume
6. Startup command
7. Detached (default)

<h3><u>Kubernetes Objects Management</u></h3> 
-> The kubectl command line tool supports several different ways to create and manage Kubernetes object.
-> Management Technique - 
   - Imperative Commands (Operates On: Live Objects, Recommended Environment: Development Projects)
   - Declarative Object Configuration (Operates On: Individual files {JSON/YML}, Recommended Environment: Production)
-> Declarative is about describing what you are trying to achieve, without instructing how to do it.
-> Imperative, explicitly tells "how to accomplish it".

Example: kubectl api-resources
