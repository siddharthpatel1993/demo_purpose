<pre><h4>
-> In a typical IT environment, storage is managed by the storage/system administrator. The end user will just get instructions to use the storage, but does not have to worry
   about the underlying storage management.
-> In the containerized world, we would like to follow similar rules, but it becomes challenging, given the many volume types we have seen earlier Kubernetes resolve
   this problem with the Persistent Volume (PV) subsystem.
-> A Persistent Volume is a cluster-wide resource that you can use to store data in a way that it persuits beyond the lifetime of a pod.
-> The PV is not backed by locally attached storage on a worker node, but by network storage system such as EBS or nfs or a distributed file system like Corph.
-> K8s provides APIs for users and administrator to manage and consume storage to manage volume, it uses the Persistent Volume API resource type and to consume it,
   uses the PersistentVolume-claim API resource type. 

PersistentVolumeClaim

-> In order to use a PV you need to claim it first, using a Persistent Volume Claim(PVC).
-> The PVC request a PV with your desired specification (size, access, modes, speed etc.) from Kubernetes and once a suitable persistent volume is found, it is bound to a PersistentVolumeClaim.
-> After a successful bound to a pod, you can mount it as a volume.
-> Once a user finishes its works, the attached Persistent volume can be released. The underlying PV can be reclaimed and recycled for future usage.

AWS EBS
-> An AWS EBS volume mounts an AWS EBS volume into your pod. Unlike emptyDir, which is erased when a pod is removed, the contents of an EBS volume are preserved and the volume is merely unmounted.

There are some restrictions -
1. The nodes on which pods are running must be AWS EC2 instances.
2. Those instances need to be in the same region and Availability Zone as the EBS volume.
3. EBS only supports a single EC2 instance mounting a volume.
