<pre><h4>
-> You can name your object, but if many are using the cluster then it would be difficult for managing.
-> A namespace is a group of releated elements that each have unique name or identifier. 
-> Namespace is used to uniquely identify one or more names from other similar names of different objects, groups or the namespace in general.
-> Kubernetes namespaces help different projects, teams or customers to share a Kubernetes cluster and provides -
   - A scope of every names
   - A mechanism to attach authorization and policy to a subsection of the cluster.
-> By default, a Kubernetes cluster will instantiate a default namespace when provisioning the cluster to hold the default set of pods, services and Deployments used
   by the cluster.
-> We can use resource quota on specifying how many resources each namespace can use.
-> Most Kubernetes resources (eg - Pod, Services, replication controller and others) are in same namespace and low-level resources such as nodes and persistent volumes
    are not in any namespace.
-> Namespaces are intended for use in environments with many users spread across multiple teams, or projects. For cluster with a few to tens of users, you should not need
   need to create or think about namespace at all.

Create new namespace

-> Let us assume we have shared k8s cluster for dev and production cases.
-> The dev team would like to maintain a space in cluster when they can get a view on the list of Pods, Services and Deployments they use to build and run their application.
   In this, no restrictions are put on who can or cannot modify resources to enable agile development.
-> For production team, we can enforce strict procedure on who can or cannot modify the set of pods, service and deployments.

Mapping compute resources for containers

-> A pod in Kubernetes will run with no limits on CPU and memory.
-> You can optionally specify how much CPU and memory(RAM) each container needs.
-> Scheduler decides about which node to place pods, only if the node has enough CPU resources available to satisfy the pod CPU request.
-> CPU is specified in units of cores and memory is specified in units of bytes.

Two type of constraints can be set for each resource type - Request and Limits
-> A request is the amount of that resources that the system will guarantee for the container and Kubernetes will use this value to decide on which node to place the pod.
-> A limit is the max amount of resources that Kubernetes will allow the container to use. In the case that request is not set for a container, it default to limits. If limit is not set, then it default to 0.
-> CPU values are specified in 'millicpu' and memory in MiB.

Resource Quota
-> A Kubernetes cluster can be divided into namespaces. If a container is created in a namespace that has a default CPU limit, and the container does not specify its own CPU limit, then the container is assigned the default CPU limit.
-> Namespaces can be assigned resource quota objects, this will limit the amount of usage allowed to the objects in that namespace.
-> You can limit - 
   1. Compute or CPU
   2. Memory or RAM
   3.Storage.

-> Here, two restrictions that a resource quota imposes on a namespace.
   1. Every container that runs in the namespace must have its own CPU limit.
   2. The total amount of CPU used by all containers in the namespace must not exceed a specified limit.
