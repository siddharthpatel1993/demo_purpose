<html><u><center><h2>Health Check and LivenessProbe</h2></center></u>
<pre><h4>
-> A pod is considered ready when all of its containers are ready.
-> In order to verify if a container in Pod is Healthy and ready to serve traffic, Kubernetes provides for a range of healthy checking mechanism.
-> Health Checks or probes are carried out by the Kublet to determine when to recreate a container (For liveness probe) and used by services and deployments to 
   determine if a pod should receive traffic.
-> For eg - Liveness Probes could catch a deadlock, where an application is running, but unable to make progress. Restarting a container in such as state can 
   help to make the application more available despite bugs.
-> One use of readiness probes is to control which pods are used as backends for services when a pod is not ready, it is removed from service load balancers.
-> For running health checks, we would use cmds specific to the application.
-> If the cmd succeeds and it returns 0, the kublet considers the container to be alive and healthy.
-> If the command returns a non-zero value, the kublet kill the pods and recreate it.
