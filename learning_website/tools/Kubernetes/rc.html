<u>Scaling and Replication</u>
-> Kubernetes was designed to orchestrate multiple containers and replication.
-> Need for multiple containers/replication helps us with these -

Reliability - By having multiple versions of an application, you prevent problems if one or more fails.
Load Balancing - Having multiple versions of a containers enables you to easily send traffic to different instances to prevent overloading of a single instances or node.
Scaling - When load does become too much for the number of existing instances, Kubernetes enables you to easily scale up your application, adding additional instances as needed.
Rolling Updates - Updates to a service by replacing pods one by one.

<u>Replication Controller</u>
-> A replication controller is a object that enables you to easily create multiple pods, then make sure that number of pods always exist.
-> If a pod created using RC will be automatically replaced if they does crash, failed or terminated.
-> RC is recommended if you just want to make sure 1 pod is always running, even after system reboots.
-> You can run the RC with 1 replica and the RC will make sure the pod is always running.

kind: ReplicationController   -> this define to create the object of replication type
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: myreplica
spec:
  replicas: 2            -> this element defines the desired number of pods
  selector:        -> tells the controller which pods to watch/belong to this RC
    myname: bhupinder  -> this must match the labels
  template:                -> template element defines a template to launch a new pod
    metadata:
      name: testpod6
      labels:            -> selectors values need to match the labels values specified in the pod template
        myname: bhupinder
    spec:
     containers:
       - name: c00
         image: ubuntu
         command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "while true; do echo Hello-Bhupinder; sleep 5 ; done"]

-> kubectl scale --replicas=8 rc -l myname=bhupinder
