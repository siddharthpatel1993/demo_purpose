<html><h3>Ansible Modules</h3>
<h4> <pre>
=> Ansible ships with a number of modules (called 'module library') that can be executed directly on remote hosts or through playbooks.

=> Your library of modules can reside on any machine, and there are no servers, daemons, or database required.

<mark>Where are ansible modules stored?</mark>
The default location for the inventory file is /etc/ansible/hosts.

Some examples - 
ansible demo -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=present"

ansible demo -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=latest"

ansible demo -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=absent"

ansible demo -b -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"

ansible demo -b -m user -a "name=sidd"

ansible demo -b -m copy -a "src=file dest=/tmp"
