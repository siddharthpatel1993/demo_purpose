Ansible names came from the sc-fie book where it was a device which communicates to another universe without any time delay.
Snowflake servers -> A snow flake server is a server that  is something that you set up by hand oor you have manual processes invloved in managing
that server, and you can't get the server back to a clean state with a click of a button or running one command.

Ansible allows you to run some commnads in background.
-B = How long you allow the job to run in sec (if the job will run more than specified time, then Ansible will kill it. Just to make sure the job sould not run forever)
-P = Gives the pulling time in seconds. This is how often Ansible will check if job is completed or not.
Example -> ansible -i inventory multi -b -B 3600 -P 0 -a "yum -y update"
After running this command you will get result file. In the result filem you will job id. The job id can be used to check the status of the command later.
Example -> ansible -i inventory multi -b -m async_status -a "jid=...."
It good to log the above task somewhere, because ansible will not let you know in case if it fails, you have to do it manually.

For idempotence, what if you want to use a task like update_cache on Debian/Ubuntu?

How to get the better result or representation of setup output.

==========================
Enviroment variable can be set in four formats
1. Normal user level
2. Global level
3. Task level / task based environemntal setting
4. Playbook level

1,2 would be persistent and 3,4 would not

1. Normal user level

---
- name: Let's do some work
  hosts: amazonhost
  tasks:
          - name: Add environmental variable to the remote user's shell
            lineinfile:
                    dest: ~/.bash_profile
                    regex: '^ENV_VAR'
                    line: 'ENV_VAR=NidhiILoveYou'
            become: no

          - name: Get the value of environemntal variable
            shell: 'source ~/.bash_profile && echo $ENV_VAR'
            register: foo
            become: no

          - name: Display the enviroenmental variable
            debug: msg="The variable is {{foo.stdout}}"
            become: no
2. Global level

- name: Let's do some work
  hosts: amazonhost

  tasks:
          - name: Add environmental variable to the remote user's shell
            lineinfile:
                    dest: /etc/environment
                    regex: '^ENV_VAR'
                    line: 'ENV_VAR=NidhiILoveYou'
                    #become: no

          - name: Get the value of environemntal variable
            shell: 'source /etc/environment && echo $ENV_VAR'
            register: foo
            #become: no

          - name: Display the enviroenmental variable
            debug: msg="The variable is {{foo.stdout}}"

            notify: restart apache

======================

===========Environment variables ============
1. For setting environment varibale globally
/etc/environment

2. Setting environmnet variable at user level 

          - name: Add an environment vatiable to the remote user's shell
            lineinfile:
                    dest: "~/.bash_profile"
                    regex: '^ENV_VAR1='
                    line: 'ENV_VAR1=value1' 
            become: no
            #hosts: amazonhost
          - name: Get the valye of environment variable
            shell: 'source ~/.bash_profile && echo $ENV_VAR'
            register: foo
            become: no

          - debug: msg="The variable is {{ foo.stdout }}"
            become: no

2. Task based environment setting
	see the video, episode 5 time 34:14

3. Playbook based environment setting

1,2 will be persisted but 3,4 won't be persisted. 3,4 will insert again  or change after every playbook run 

4. Centos, RedHat, Fedora are same OS, ubuntu, Debain are a same

5. Variable + with_first_found module 

6. vars, vars_files and include_vars are some different way of assinging variables in playbook

7. accessing variable from debug -> debug: var=foo.rc or debug: var=foo['rc']

8. import_tasks and include_tasks does the same thing, getting the task or other information from the other file. However, include used for dynamic variable.
   Always use import, if something breaks switch it to include.

8. You can put register in all the task to check the output

9. You can even include playbook, import_playbook

===============condition============
when, changed_when, failed_when 
ignore_errors: true
=============tags====
put tag in playbook(tasks)
tags:
	- api
	- echo
	
ansible-playbook main.yml --tags=api
