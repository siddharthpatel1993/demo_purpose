<html><h3><u>Handlers</u></h3>
<h4><pre>
=> A handler is exactly the same as a task, but it will run when called by another task.
	or
=> Handlers are just like regular task in an ansible playbook, but are only run if the task contains a notify directive and also indicates that it changed something.
=> Don't presume handlers will run automatically, unless and untill it's been called from some another task and then status of the task is changing as well.
=> It will run at the end of the playbook, unless untill you're putting a task for meta flush handlers
=> You can define hanlders on the top or bottom because it's dicnory.
=> If you use --force-handlers on the ansible-playbook command, then handlers will get executed if the playbook fails also.
Example :- ansible-playbook -i inventory apache.yml --force-handlers
=> The handlers can have list, and can be called from another handlers.
