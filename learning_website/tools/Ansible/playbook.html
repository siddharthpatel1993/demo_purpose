<html><h3><u>Playbooks</u></h3>
<h4><pre>
=> Playbook in ansible is written written in YAML format.

=> It is human readable data serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files.

=> Playbook is like a file where you can write codes. It consist of Variables, tasks, files, templates and roles.

=> Each Playbook is composed of one or more 'modules' in a list. Module is a collection of configuration files.

=> Playbooks are divided in many sections like - 
Target section -> Defines the host against which playbooks task has to be executed.
Variable Section -> Defines Variables
Task Section -> List of all the modules that we need to run in an order.   

<u>YAML (Yet Another Markup Language)</u>

=> For ansible, nearly every YAML files starts with a list.

=> Each item in a list is a list of key-value pairs, commonly called a Dictionary.

=> All YAML files can begin with "---" and ends with "...", but not mandetory.

=> All members of a list lines must begin with same identation level starting with "-". 

For eg :-  
--- # A list of fruits
Fruits:
 - Mango
 - Strawberry
 - Banana
 - Grapes
 - Apple
 
 => A Dictionary is represented in a simple key: value form.
 
 For eg. 
 --- #Details of an employee
 Employee:
  name: Siddharth
  Company: Ericsson
  Skills: Ansible
  Experience: 5 years

Note:- There should be space between : and value.

<u>DRYRUN</u>

Check whether the playbook is formatted correctly.
