<html><h2><u><center>Ansible Inventory and Host Patterns</center></u></h2>
<pre><h4>
<h3><u>Ansible Inventory -</u></h3>
-> Ansible can work with multiple systems in your infrastructure at the same time.
-> In order to work with multiple servers, Ansible needs to establish connectivity to those servers.
-> This is done with SSH for Linux and PowerShell remoting for windows that would make Ansible agentless.
-> Agentless means you don't need to install any additional software on the Target machines to be able to work with Ansible.
-> One of the major disadvantages of the other automation tools is that you need to install and configure agents on the target machines before you can invoke any kind of 
   automation.
-> Now the information about these target systems is stored in an file called inventory file.
-> <mark>If you don't create a new inventory file Ansible uses its default inventory file located at /etc/ansible/hosts.</mark>
-> The inventory file is an INI like format. But it can be YAML and other. 
-> Its simply number of servers listed one after the others.
-> You can define group of groups.
-> You can also the the alias name to any server listed in inventory file.
-> You can create host and inventory file based on your project under project directory, the global one would be /etc/ansible location.

<h3><u>There are couple of ways you can write the inventory file. Some of the methods are mentioned below:- </u></h3>

<u>Case 1 -</u>

1. You can enter the name of the group within a pair of square brackets and define the list of servers as the part of that group in the lines below.
2. You can have multiple such groups defined in a single inventory file, this is so because you can target a group of servers for any ansible playbook to configure all of them 
   at once.
3. Finally, you can also have a group of groups.
4. In order to define a group of groups follow the same pattern as group creation except in this case you must add a colon followed by the keyword childern to the parent 
   group's name.
5. In this case, I would like to create a group named all_servers that contains all servers in the group ubuntuhost and amazonhost.

Example :-

[ubuntuhost]
ansible_practice_ubuntuhost_1
ansible_practice_ubuntuhost_2

[amazonhost]
ansible_practice_amazonlinuxhost_1
ansible_practice_amazonlinuxhost_2

[all_server:children]
ubuntuhost
amazonhost

[all_server:vars]
ansible_ssh_user=normaluser
ansible_ssh_pass=normaluser123

<u> Case 2 -</u>
Let's take a look at the different version of the inventory file. 

1. For example, I have a list of servers named ubuntuhost(1/2) and amazonhost(1/2) as shown in the following example.
2. However, I would like to refer to these servers in ansible using alias such as host1, host2, host3 and host4.
3. I could deal this by adding an alias for each server at the beginning of the line and assinging the address of the server to ansible_host parameter. 

Example:- 

host1 ansible_ssh_host=ansible_practice_ubuntuhost_1 ansible_ssh_user=normaluser ansible_ssh_pass=normaluser123 
host2 ansible_ssh_host=ansible_practice_ubuntuhost_2 ansible_ssh_user=normaluser ansible_ssh_pass=normaluser123

host3 ansible_ssh_host=ansible_practice_amazonlinuxhost_1 ansible_ssh_user=normaluser ansible_ssh_pass=normaluser123
host4 ansible_ssh_host=ansible_practice_amazonlinuxhost_2 ansible_ssh_user=normaluser ansible_ssh_pass=normaluser123
    
<u><h3>A brief explanation of each parameter is mentioned below:-</u></h3>

<u>a. Ansible_host -</u> It is an inventory parameter used to specify FQDN or IP address of a server.

<u>b. Ansible_connection -</u> It defines how ansible connects to the target server. This is how we define a target host we wish to connect to in a Linux or a windows host.
                               You could also set it to localhost to indicare that you would like to work with localhost and not connet to nay remote host.
			       If you don't have multiple remote servers to play around with, you can simply start with localhost into an inventory file.	 

Example :- ansible_connection: ssh/winrm/localhost

<u>c. Ansible_port -</u> It defines which port to connect to. By default, it is set to 22 for SSH. But if you need to change that for some reason you can set it differently using 
                         ansible_port parameter.

Example:- ansible_port: 22/ 5986
 
<u>d. Ansible_user -</u> It defines the user to make remote connections. If you need to change that, define it as shown here.
  
Example:- ansible_user: root/ administrator

<u>e. Ansible_ssh_pass -</u> It defines the SSH password for Linux. (Not recommended)

Example:- ansible_ssh_pass: password

Note:
<mark>1. To use the password type inventory, ansible server should sshpass installed and host_key_checking false in ansible.cfg file. </mark>
2. Using a password with SSH is not a recommended way in a production environment. Use SSH key-based authentication is a better way to establish a connection between multiple 
   servers.

<h3><u>Ansible Host Patterns-</u></h3>

=> you can put --limit on adhoc command to limit to one or two servers
=> "all" pattern refers to all the machines in an inventory

=> ansible all --list-hosts
=> ansible [group-name] --list-hosts
=> ansible [group-name][0] --list-hosts 

groupname[0] -> picks first machine of group
groupname[1] -> picks second machine of group
groupname[-1] -> picks last machine of the group
groupname[0:1] -> picks first two machine in the group
groupname[2:5] -> picks 3,4,5 and 6 machine in the group

Group separated by a colon can be used to use hosts from multiple groups
=> groupname1:groupname2
