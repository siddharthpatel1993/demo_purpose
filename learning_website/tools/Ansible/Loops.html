<html><h3><u>Loops</u></h3>
<h4><pre>
Sometimes you want to repeat a task multiple times. In computer programming this is called loops. Common Ansible loops include changing ownership on
several files and/or directories with the file module, creating multiple users with user module, and repeating a polling step untill certain result
is reached.
