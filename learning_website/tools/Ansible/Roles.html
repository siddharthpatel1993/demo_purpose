<html><h3><u>Roles</u></h3>
<h4><pre>
=> We can use two techniques for reusing set of tasks :- <mark>includes and roles.</mark>

=> Roles are good for organising tasks and encapsulating data needed to accomplish those task.

=> We can organise playbooks into directory structure called roles.

=> Adding more and more functionality to the playbooks will make it diffcult to maintain in a single file.

=> Roles contains directory for <u>Default, files, Handlers, Meta, Templates, Tasks, Vars etc.</u>

Explanation of the directories in a role :-

<mark><u>Default</u></mark> => It stores the data about role/application default variables. For eg. if you want to run to port 80 or 8080 then variables needs to define in this path. 

<mark><u>Files</u></mark> => It contains files need to be transferred to the remote VM (static files)

<mark><u>Handlers</u></mark> => They are triggers or task. We can segregate all the handlers required in Playbook.

<mark><u>Meta</u></mark> => This directory contain files that establish roles dependencies eg-> Author Name, Supported platform, dependencies if any.

<mark><u>Tasks</u></mark> => It contains all the tasks that is normally in the playbook. Eg -> Installing packages and copies files etc.

<mark><u>Vars</u></mark> => Variables for the role can be specified in the directory and used in your configuration files. Both Vars and default stores variables.
