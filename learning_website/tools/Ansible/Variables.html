<html><h3><u>Variables</u></h3>
<h4><pre>
=> Ansible uses variables which are defined previously to enable more flexibility in playbooks and roles. They can be used to loop through a set of given values, access various information like the hostname of a system and replace certain strings in templates with specific values.
=> Put variable sction above the tasks so that we define it first and use it later.
