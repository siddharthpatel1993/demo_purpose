<pre><h4>
There are three ways you can protect or manage the IPv4, which are as follows -
1. Use Private IP ( 10.0.0.0 for class A, 172.16.X.X for class B, 192.0.0.0 for class C)
2. Use IPv6
3. Do Subnetting

<h3><u>Subnetting</u></h3>
-> What is subnneting and why do we need it?
-> Always remember, there must be different network on all the different interfaces connected to the router. That means all the interface has different n/w id.
-> What is router? Inter-networking device. We generally use it if we need to establish conenction b/w two different n/w.
-> If we have to establish conenction within network or devices having same n/w id then we will use switch.
-> By default CIDR value for class A is 8, class B is 16, class C is 24. 
-> It is network within a network or logically divison of IP addresses.

-> There are two ways of doing subnneting, according to hosts requirement and according to n/w requirement.

<h3><u>i). According to hosts requirement</u></h3>
<img src="pic/subnet_1.JPG" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:800px;height:400px;">

1. First find out total number of hosts, on the basis of the requirment.
2. Check how many n/w you need.
3. Write down the network, find the class and find the number of octect for n/w and no of octect of hosts.
4. Change the hosts part into binary.
5. Find the maximum number of hosts to be connected in one interface.
6. Find the value of n.
7. Write the step 2 result again
