<h4><pre> 
-> Whenever failover occurs, AWS RDS sends SNS notification.
-> You can use API calls to find out the RDS events occurred in the last 14 days. 
-> Even, you can use CLI to view last 14 days events.
-> Using AWS console, you can view only last one day events.
-> In case of OS patching, System upgrades, DB scaling these things happen on standby first and then on primary to avoid outage.  

<h3><u>RDS Multi-AZ Deployment Maintenance</u></h3>
-> Firstly, perform maintenance on standby.
-> Now, convert standby into primary, so that maintenance can be done on primary (currently)
-> You can manually upgrade a DB instance to a supported DB engine version from AWS console as follows -
   - ( RDS -> DB instance -> Modify DB -> Set DB Engine version)
-> By default, change will take effect during the next maintenance window. 
-> Or, you can force an immediate upgrade if you want.
-> In multi-AZ, version upgrade will be conducted on both primary and standby at the same time, which will cause an outage.
-> Do it during maintenance window.

<h3><u>Backup of RDS</u></h3>
-> There are two methods to backup and restore your RDS DB instances
1. AWS RDS Automated Backup
2. User Initiated Manual Backup

-> Either you can take backup of entire DB instance or just the DB.
-> You can create a storage volume snapshots of your entire DB instances.
-> Automated Backups by AWS, backup your DB data to multiple AZ to provide for data durability.
   (Select -> Automated Backup in AWS console)
-> Stored in Amazon S3
-> Multi-AZ automated backups will be taken from the standby instance.
-> The DB instance must be in "ACTIVE" state for automated backup.
-> RDS automatically backup the DB instances daily, by creating a storage volume snapshot of your DB instance (fully daily snapshot) including the DB transaction logs.
-> It will store the backup data in some AZ, by default it contains the backup of 7 days. You can modify the retention period from 1 to 35 days.   
-> You can decide, when you would like to take backup (window).
-> No additional charge for RDS backing up your DB instances.
-> For Multi-AZ deployment, backups are taken from the standby DB instance (True for MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL)
-> Automated backup are deleted when you delete your RDS DB instance.
-> An outage occurs if you change the backup retention period from zero to non-zero value or the other way around.
-> Retention period of automated backup is 7 days (by default) via AWS console.
-> AWS Aurora is an exception, its default is one day.
-> Via CLI or API, 1 day by default for all.
-> You can increase it upto 35 days.
-> If you don't want backup, put 'zero' in retention period.

-> In case of manual snapshot, point-in-time recovery is not possible.
-> Manual Snapshot is also stored in S3.
-> They are not deleted automatically, if you delete RDS instance.
-> Take a final snapshot before deleting your RDS DB instance.
-> You can share manual snapshot directly with other AWS account.
-> When you restore a DB instance, only the default DB parameters and security groups are associated with the restored instance.
-> You cannot restore a DB snapshot into an existing DB instance, rather it has to create a new DB instance. It has new endpoint.
-> Restoring from a backup or a DB snapshot changes the RDS instance endpoint.
-> At the time of restoring, you can change the storage type (General purpose or provisioned)

<h3><u>Encryption in RDS</u></h3>
-> You cannot encrypt an existing unencrypted DB instance.
-> TO do that, you need to -
   - Create a new, encrypted instance and migrate your data to it (From unencrypted to encrypted)
   - You can restore from a Backup/snapshot into a new encrypted RDS instance.
-> RDS supports encryption-at-rest for all DB engines using KMS.
-> What actually encrypted when data at rest.
1. All its snapshots
2. Backups of DB (S3 storage)
3. Data on EBS volumes
4. Read Replica created from the snapshot.

<h3><u>Some Points related to RDS Billing</h3></u>
-> No upfront cost.
-> You have to pay only for (this increases by increasing DB backups retention period) {in stand-alone case}
   1. DB instance hours (partial hour charged as full hour)
   2. Storage GB/month
   3. Internet Data transfer
   4. Backup storage (i.e. S3)
-> AWS also charge for {in multi-AZ case}
   1.  Multi-AZ DB hours
   2. Provisioned storage (Multi-AZ)
   3. Double write I/O
   4. You are not charged for DB data transfer during replication from primary to standby.
