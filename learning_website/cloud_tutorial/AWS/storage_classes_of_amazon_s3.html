<html><h2><u><center>Storage classes of Amazon S3</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre>
There are six types of storage class of Amazon S3 -
1. Amazon S3-standard (Most costly)
2. Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive (Cheapest)
3. Amazon Glacier {Long Term Storage}
4. Amazon S3 Standard Infrequent Access or Standard - IA {Cost less but you pay to access it more frequently}
5. Amazon S3 one-zone IA 
6. Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering

Note: S3 - Reduced Redundancy Storage is no more storage class now.

<h3><u>Amazon S3 standard</u></h3>
-> S3 standard offers high durability, availability and performance object storge for frequently accessed data.
-> Durability is 99.999999999%
-> Designed for 99.99% availability over a given year
-> Support SSL for data in-transit and encryption of data at rest.
-> The storage cost for the object is fairly high, but there is very less charge for accessing the objects.
-> Large object that can be uploaded in a single PUT is 5 GB.

<h3><u>Amazon S3 - IA</u></h3>
-> S3 IA is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed.
-> The storage cost is much cheaper than s3-standard, almost half the price. But you are charged more heavily for accessing your objects.
-> Durability is 99.999999999%
-> Resilient against events that impact an entire AZ.
-> Availability is 99.9% in a year.
-> Support SSL for data in transit and encryption of data at rest.
-> Data that is deleted from S3-IA within 30 days will be charged for full 30 days.
-> Backed with the Amazon S3 Service Level Agreement for availability.

<h3><u>Amazon S3 - Intelligent Tiering</u></h3>
-> The S3 Intelligent Tiering storage class is designed to optimize cost by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier.
-> It works by storing objects in two access tiers.
-> If an object in the infrequent access tier is accessed, it is automatically moved back to the frequent access tier.
-> There are no retrieval fees when using the S3-Intelligent Tiering storage class and no additional tiering fee when objects are moved between access tiers.
-> Same low latency and high performance of S3-standard.
-> Object less than 128 kb cannot move to IA.
-> Durability is 99.999999999%
-> Availability is 99.9%

<h3><u>Amazon One-Zone IA</u></h3>
-> S3 One Zone IA is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed.
-> Data store in single AZ.
-> Ideal for those, who want lower cost option of IA-data
-> It is good choice for storing secondary backup copies of on-premise data or easily recreatable data.
-> You can use S3 lifecycle policies.
-> Durability is 99.999999999%
-> Availability is 99.5%
-> Because S3 one Zone-IA stores data in single AZ, data stored in the storage class will be lost in the event of AZ destruction.

<h3><u>Amazon S3 Glacier</u></h3>
-> S3 Glacier is a secure, durable, low cost storage class for data archiving.
-> To keep cost low yet suitable for varying needs, S3 Glacier provides three retrieval options that range from a few minutes to hours.
-> You can upload object directly to Glacier or use lifecycle policies.
-> Durability is 99.999999999%
-> Data is resilient in the event of one entire AZ destruction.
-> Support SSL for data in transit and encryption data at rest.
-> You can retrieve 10 GB of your amazon S3 Glacier data per month for free with free tier account.

<h3><u>Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive</u></h3>
-> S3 Glacier Deep Archive is Amazon S3 cheapest storage.
-> Design to retain data for long period (eg - 10 years)
-> All objects stored in S3-Glacier Deep Archive are replicated and stored across atleast at three geographically - dispersed AZ.
-> Durability is 99.999999999%
-> Ideal alternative to magnetic tape libraries.
-> Retrieval time within 12 hours.
-> Storage cost is upto 75% less than for the existing S3-Glacier storage class.
-> Availability is 99.9%
