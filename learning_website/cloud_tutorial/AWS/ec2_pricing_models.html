<html><h2><u><center>EC2 Pricing Models</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre>
-> There are generally 5 pricing models in AWS, which are as follows -
   1. On Demend
   2. Dedicated Instance
   3. Dedicated Host
   4. Spot Instance
   5. Reserved Instance
      a. Standard RI
      b. Convertible RI
      c. Schedule RI

-> But it uses three ways to pay for Amazon EC2 instance i.e. On-demend, Reserved Instance and Spot Instance.
-> Dedicated Host and Dedicated Instance usually billed on-demand.
-> Spot Instance comes with cheapest rate, then Reserved and other.
-> You can also pay for Dedicated Host, which provide you with EC2 instance capacity on physical servers dedicated for your use.
-> By default, we select t2.micro free tier comes with on-demend.
    
<u>1. On Demend</u>:
-> AWS on demand instances are Virtual Servers that run in AWS or AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) and it allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) 
   with no commitments.

<h3><u>On Demand Pricing is useful for:-></u></h3>
-> Users that want low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any upfront payment or long term commitment.
-> Applications with short-term, spiky or unpredictable workloads that can't be interrupted.
-> Applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time.
-> They are also suitable for use during testing and development of applications on EC2.
-> With On-demend instances you only pay for EC2 instances you use.
-> The use of on-demand instances frees you from the cost and complexities of planning, purchasing and maintaining Hardware and transforms what are commonly large fixed costs 
   into much smaller variable cost.
-> Pricing is per instance-hour consumed for each instance, from the time an instance is launched until it is terminated or stopped.
-> Each partial instance hour consumed will be billed per second for Linux Instances and as a full hour for all other instances types.
 
<mark>Note: Linux instance is by the second and windows is by hour.</mark>

<u>2. Reserved</u>:
-> Amazon EC2 RI provide a significant discount (upto 75%) compared to on-demend pricing and provide a capacity reservation when used in a specific availablity zone.
-> Reserved instances give you the option to reserve a DB instance for a one or three year term and in turn receive a significant discount compared to the on-demand instance 
   pricing for the DB instance.
-> Provides you with a capacity reservation and offers a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance.
-> Contract terms are 1 year or 3 years.
-> If you want to take an advantage of the capacity reservation, then you should buy an RI in a specific Availability Zone. 
-> There are three types of Reserved Pricing - Standard Reserved Instances, Convertible Reserved Instances, Scheduled Reserved Instances.
   
   <u>1. Standard Reserved Instances -</u>
   -> These provide the most significant discount offer (upto 75% off on demand instances) and are best suited for steady-state usage.
   -> The more you pay upfront and the longer the contract, the greater the discount.

   <u>2. Convertible Reserved Instances -</u>   
    -> These offer upto 54% off on demand and the capacity to change the attributes of the reserved instances as long as the exchange results in the creation of 
       reserved instances of equal or greater value.  
	   
   <u>3. Scheduled Reserved Instances -</u>
   -> These are available to launch within the time windows you reserve.
   -> Schedule Reserve Instances enable you to purchase capacity reservations that recur on a daily, weekly or monthly basis, with a specified start and duration, for a one 
      year term.
   -> You reserve the capacity in advance so that you know it is available when you need it.
   -> You pay for the time that the instances are scheduled, even if you do not use them.
   -> Schedule instances are good choice for workloads that do not run continuously, but do run on a regular schedule.

For eg -> You can use schedule instances for an application that runs during business hours or for Batch Processing that run at the end of the week.
	
<h3><u>Reserved Pricing is useful for:-></u></h3> 
-> Applications with steady state or predictable usage.
-> Applications that require reserved capacity.
-> Users able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs even further.

Q -> Can I transfer a convertible or standard RI from one Region to another?
No 

Q -> How do I change the configuration of a convertible RI?
You can change the configuration of a convertible RI using EC2 Management Console or the get Reserved Instance Management Quota API.

Q -> Do I need to pay a fee when I exchange my convertible RI?
No, however you need to pay for the delta.

<u>3. Spot</u>:
-> Amazon EC2 spot instances let you take advantage of unused EC2 capacity in the AWS cloud. Spot instances are available at upto 90% discount compared to on-demand prices.
-> You can use spot-instances for various test and development workloads.
-> You also have the options to hibernate, stop or terminate your spot instances when EC2 reclaims the capacity back with two minutes of notice.
-> In the case of Hibernate, your instance gets hibernated and the RAM data persisted. In the case of Stop, your instance gets shutdown and RAM is cleared.
-> With hibernate, Spot instances will pause and resume around any interruptions so your workloads can pick up from exactly where they left off.
-> Spot uses the same underlying EC2 instances as on-demand and reserved Instances, and is best suited for flexible workloads.
-> You can request spot instances upto your spot limit for each region.
-> Enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your application have flexible start and end times.
-> You can determine the status of your spot request via spot request status code and message. You can access spot request status information on the spot instance page of the 
   EC2 console of the AWS management console.

Q -> When would my spot ins get interrupts?

Primary Reason would be Amazon EC2 capacity requirement (eg - On-demend or Reserved instances)
Secondary, if you have chosen to set a 'max spot price' and the spot price rises above that.

<h3><u>Spot Pricing is useful for:-></u></h3>
-> Applications that have flexible start and end time.
-> Applications that are only flexible at very low compute prices.
-> Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity.

<u>4. Dedicated hosts</u>:
-> Dedicated Host gives you additional visibility and control over how instances are placed on a physical server, and you can consistently deploy your instances to the same 
   server over time.
-> As a result Dedicated host enables you to use your existing server bound software licenses and address corporate compliance and regulatory requirements.
-> Instances that run on a dedicated host are the same virtualized instances that you had get with traditional EC2 instances that use the Xen hypervisor.
-> Each dedicated host supports a single instance size and type (for eg. C3.XLARGE).
-> Pay for a physical host that is fully dedicated to run your instances, and bring your existing per-socket, per-core or per-VM software license to Reduce cost.

<u>4. Dedicated Instance</u>:
-> Dedicated instances are run in a VPC on Hardware that is dedicated to a single customer.
-> Your dedicated instances are physically isolated at the host hardware level from instances that belong to other AWS account.
-> Dedicated instances may share Hardware with other instances from the same AWS account that are not dedicated instance.
-> Pay for dedicated instances on-demend save upto 70% by purchasing reserved instances, or save upto 90% by purchasing spot instances.

<h3><u>Dedicated Pricing is useful for:-></u></h3>
-> Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization.
-> Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments.
-> Can be purchased on-demand (hourly).
-> can be purchased as a Reservation for up to 70% off on demand price.

<mark>Note: If the spot instance is terminated by Amazon EC2, you will not be charged for partial hour of usage.
However, if you terminate the instance yourself, you will be charged for any hour in which the instance ran.</mark>
