<h4><pre>
-> If you want to create common storage between two or more than two EC2 instances/machines and all of them can access it, read and write the data in the same region but 
   different AZ. For these kind of storage EFS has been made. 
-> As EFS would be in the same region, between different AZ. You need to select different subnets and have EC2 instance running in those subnets. So, those can access EFS.

Note: 1. EFS is only for linux operating system not for windows.
      2. It's not available for all the region.
