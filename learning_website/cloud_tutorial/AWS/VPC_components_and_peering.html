<html><h2><u><center>VPC Components and Peering</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre> 

<h3><u>1. Subnets</u></h3>
-> When you create a VPC, you must specify an IPv4 CIDR Block for the VPC. The allowed block size is b/w /16 to /28 network.
-> The first four & last IP addresses of subnet cannot be assigned.

For Example - Suppose we have taken the subnet 10.0.0.0/16. 
so, 10.0.0.0 - Network address
    10.0.0.1 - Reserved by AWS for VPC router
	10.0.0.2 - Reserved by AWS (the IP address of DNS server)
	10.0.0.3 - Reserved for future use
	10.0.0.255 - Broadcast Address
	
Note: AWS do not support Broadcast in a VPC but reserve this address.

<u>a. Public Subnet</u>
-> If a subnet's traffic is routed to an Internet Gateway, then the subnet is known as a Public Subnet.
-> If you want your instance in a Public subnet to communicate with the internet over IPv4, it must have a public IPv4 address or an elastic IP address.
-> The instances in the public subnet can send outbound traffic directly to the internet, but instances in Private subnet can't. 

<u>b. Private Subnet</u>
-> If a subnet does not have a route to the internet gateway, the subnet is known as a private subnet.   


<h3><u>2. Implied Router & Route Table</u></h3>
-> It is the Central Routing Function.
-> It connects the different AZ together and connects the VPC to the Internet Gateway
-> You can have upto 200 Route Tables per VPC
-> You can have upto 50 Route Entries per Route Table
-> Each subnet must be associated with only Route table at any given time.
-> If you donot specify a subnet to Route table association, the subnet will be associated with the default VPC Route table.
-> You can also edit the main Route table if you need, but you cannot delete main Route table.
-> However you can make custom Route table manually become the main Route table then you can delete the former main, as it is no longer a main Route table.
-> You can associate multiple subnets with the same Route table.

<h3><u>3. Internet Gateway</u></h3>
-> An Internet Gateway is a virtual router that connects a VPC to the internet.
-> Default VPC is alreday attached with an Internet Gateway.
-> If you create a new VPC then you must attach the Internet Gateway in order to access the Internet.
-> Ensure that your subnet's Route table points to the Internet Gateway.
-> It performs NAT b/w your private and public IPv4 address.
-> It supports both IPv4 and IPv6.  

<h3><u>4. NAT Gateways</u></h3>
-> The main function of NAT Gateway is to convert the private IP to public and forward it. Also vice versa.
-> You can use a Network Address Translation Gateway to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevent the internet from initiating a connection with those instances.
-> You are charged for creating and using a NAT Gateway in your account. NAT Gateway hourly usage and data procssing rates apply. Amazon EC2 charges for data transfer also appl.
-> To create NAT Gateway, you must specify the public subnet in which the NAT Gateway should reside.
-> You must also specify an Elastic IP address to address to associate with NAT Gateway when you create it.
-> No need to assign public IP address to your private instance.
-> You can use public IP and Elastic IP in NAT instances but you can only use Elastic IP in NAT gateways.
-> After you have created a NAT gateway you must update the route table associated with one or more of your private subnets to point Internet bound traffic to the NAT gateway. This enables instances in your private subnet
   to communicate with the internet.
-> Deleting a NAT Gateway, disassociates its Elastic IP address, does not release the address from your account.

<h3><u>5. Security Groups</u></h3>
-> It is virtual firewall works at ENI level.
-> Upto 5 security groups per EC2 instances interface can be applied.
-> Can only have permit rules, cannot have deny rules.
-> Stateful, return traffic of allowed inbound traffic is allowed, even if there are no rules to allow it. 

<h3><u>6. Network ACL</u></h3>
-> It is function performed on the implied router.
-> NACL is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets.
-> Your VPC automatically comes with a modifiable default Network ACL. By default, it allows all inbound and outbound IPv4 traffic and if applicable, IPv6 traffic.
-> You can create a custom network ACL and associate it with a subnet. By default, each custom Network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic untill you add rules.
-> Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a Network ACL. If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a Network ACL, the subnet is automatically associated with the default Network ACL.
-> You can associate a NACL with multiple subnet, however a subnet can be associated with only one NACL with a subnet, the previous association will be removed.
-> A NACL contains a numbered list of rules that we evaluate in order, starting with the lowest numembered rule. 
-> The highest number that you can use for a Rule is 32766. Recommended that you start by creating Rules with Rule Numbers that a multiple of 100, so that you can insert new rules where you need later.
-> It functions at subnet level.
-> NACL are stateless, outbound traffic for an allowed inbound traffic must be explicitly allowed too.
-> You can have permit and deny rules in a NACL.

<h3><u>Difference b/w Security Group and NACL</u></h3>
Security Group
-> Operate at instance level.
-> Support allows rules only.
-> Stateful, return traffic is automatically allowed.
-> Applies to an instance only.

NACL
-> Operate at the subnet level.
-> It permits allow as well as deny rules.
-> Stateless, return traffic must be explicitly allowed by rules.
-> Applies to all instances in the subnet.

<h3><u>VPC Peering</u></h3>
-> A VPC Peering connection is a networking connection b/w two VPC that enables you to route traffic b/w them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses.
-> Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network.
-> You can create a VPC Peering connection b/w your own VPC, or with a VPC in another AWS account. The VPC can be in different region.
