<html><h2><u><center>EBS Snapshot of Root Volume and Non Root Volume</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre>
-> EBS Snapshots are point-in-time images/copies of your EBS volume.
-> Any data written to the volume after the snapshot process is initiated, will not be included in the resulting snapshot (but will be included in future, incremental update)
-> Per AWS account, upto 5000 EBS volumes can be created.
-> Per account, upto 10,000 EBS snapshots can be created.
-> EBS snapshots are stored in S3, however you cannot access them directly. You can only access them through EC2 APIs.
-> While EBS volumes are AZ specific, snapshots are Region specific.  
-> Any AZ in Region can use Snapshot to create EBS Volume.
-> To migrate an EBS from one AZ to another, create snapshot (region specific) and create EBS volume from the snapshot in the intended AZ.
-> You can create a snapshot to an EBS volume of the same or larger size than the original volume size from which the snapshot was initially created. 
-> You can take a snapshot of non-root EBS volume while the volume is in use on running EC2 instance.
-> This means, you can still access it while the snapshot is being processed.
-> However the snapshot will only include data that is already written to your volume.
-> The snapshot is created immediately, but it may stay pending status until the full snapshot is completed. This may take few hours to complete, specially for the first time
   snapshot of a volume.
-> During the period, when the snapshot status is pending, you can still access the volume (non-root/non-boot), but I/O might be slower because of the snapshot activity.
-> While in pending state, an in-process snapshot will not include data from ongoing reads and writes to the volume.
-> To take complete snapshot of your non-root EBS volume - stop or unmount the volume.
-> To create a snapshot for root EBS volume, you must stop the instance first then take the snapshot. 

<h3><u>Incremental Snapshot</u></h3>
-> EBS snapshots are stored incrementally.
-> For low cost storage on S3 and a guarantee to be able to fully restore data from snapshots.
-> What you need is a single snapshot, then further snapshots will only carry the changed blocks (incremental updates)
-> Therefore you do not need to have multiple full/complete copies of the snapshot.
-> You are charged for data transfer to S3 from your EBS volume you are taking snapshot.
-> Snapshot stored in S3.
-> First snapshot is a clone, subsequent snapshots are incremental.
-> Deleting snapshot will only remove data exclusive to the snapshot. 
-> If you delete the first snapshot then, AWS automatically shift the content of first snapshot data to its successive snapshot ( i.e. snapshots2).
-> If snapshot2 has to be get deleted, then it shift the data to snapshot3 and so on.
