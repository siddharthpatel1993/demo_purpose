<html><h2><u><center>Elastic Block Store</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre>
There are two types of storages are available for EC2 -
1. Elastic Block Storage 
   - Persistent (In case of reboot, stop. In case of termination it gets deleted by default but we can uncheck the "Delete on Termination" to save it)
   - Network attached Virtual Drive
   
2. Instance Storage (Instance store Backed EC2 basically the virtual Hard drive on the host allocated to the EC2 instance)
   - Limited to 10GB per device
   - Ephemeral Storage (Non-Persistent Storage)
   - The EC2 instance can't be stopped, can only be rebooted. Stop or termination will delete the data.   
   
Note: 
-> Root/Boot volume are the storages where EC2 instance O.S. get installed and kept.
-> Bootable volumes are volumes where you can install O.S. ( Example C drive in windows O.S.)
-> Non-Bootable volumes are volumes where you can't install O.S. and it is used for other storages ( D,E drives in windows)
-> EBS volumes behave like RAW, unformatted, external block storage devices that you can attach to your EC2 instance.
-> EBS volumes are block storage devices suitable for database style data that requires frequent reads and write 
-> EBS volumes are attached to your EC2 instance through the AWS network, like Virtual hard drives
-> An EBS volume can attach to a single EC2 instance only at a time
-> Both EBS volume and EC2 instance must be in the same AZ.
-> An EBS volume data is replicated by AWS across multiple servers in the same AZ to prevent data loss resulting from any single AWS component failure.
-> Extra Volume will not get deleted by default after termination.
-> Throughput is the way to check how fast the data can transfer.
-> IOPS (Input Output per Second) is a way to check how fast the data will read and write per second i.e. transaction per second.
-> SSD measured in IOPS and HDD measured in througput MB/S. 

There are 3 types of EBS Volumes
1. SSD(Solid State Drive) Backed Volume
   a. General Purpose SSD (gp2) {default volume, 30 GB windows, Bootable)
   b. Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) {bootable}
2. HDD (Hard Disk Drive) Backed Volume
   a. Throughput optimized HDD (st1) {non-bootable}
   b. Cold HDD (sc1) {non-bootable}
3. Magnetic Standard {bootable}

<h3><u>General Purpose SSD (gp2)</u></h3>
-> GP2 is the default EBS volume type for the amazon EC2 instance
-> GP2 volumes are backed by SSDs
-> General Purpose balances both price and performance
-> Ration of 3 IOPS/GB with upto 10,000 IOPS
-> Boot Volume having low latency
-> Volume size - 1GB to 16 TB
-> Price - $0.10 GB/month

<h3><u>Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)</u></h3>
-> These volumes are ideal for both IOPS intensive and throughput itensive workloads that require extremely low latency or the mission critical applications.
-> Designed for I/O intensive applications such as large relational or NoSQL databases
-> Use if you need more than 10,000 IOPS
-> Can provision upto 32,000 IOPS per volume (Special case like Nitro based instances it can go upto 64,000 IOPS)
-> Volume size - 4GB to 16TB
-> Price - $0.125 GB /month 

<h3><u>Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)</u></h3>
-> ST1 is backed with hard disk sfrive and is ideal for frequently accessed, throughput itensive workloads with large datasets.
-> ST1 volumes deliver performance in term of throughput, measured in MB/S
-> Big data, Data Warehouse, log processing
-> It cannot be Boot Volume
-> Can provisioned upto 500 IOPS per volume
-> Volume size - 500 GB to 16 TB
-> Price - $0.045 GB/ month

<h3><u>Cold HDD (sc1)</u></h3>
-> SC1 is also backed by HDD and provides the lowest cost per GB of all EBS volume types
-> Low cost storage for infrequent access workloads
-> Used in file servers
-> Cannot be Boot volume
-> Can provisioned upto 250 IOPS per volume
-> Volume Size - 500 GB to 16 TB
-> Price - $ 0.025 GB/month
   
<h3><u>Magnetic Standard</u></h3>
-> Lowest cost per GB of all EBS volume type that is bootable.
-> Magnetic Volumes are ideal for workloads where data is accessed infrequently, and applications where the lowest storage cost is important.
-> Price - $.0.05 per GB/ month
-> Volume Size - 1 GB to 1 TB
-> Max IOPS/volume - 40 to 200
