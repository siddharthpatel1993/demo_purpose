<html><h2><u><center>AWS Storage</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre>
-> AWS offers a complete range of cloud storage services to support both application and archival compliance requirements.
-> Select from objects, file and block storage services as well as cloud data migration options to start designing the foundation of your cloud IT environment.

There are five types of Storage -
1. Simple Storage Service (S3) {Object level Storage, access it from any where}
2. Elastic File System (EFS) {Used for updation or patches for multiple servers in different region or AZ from one common place(common place is EFS), Linux based}
3. Elastic Block Storage (EBS) {Used as root storage on EC2 instance}
4. Glacier {Used for old data which is rarely used and to keep the data for long time with little latency on access. Now it is part of S3}
5. Snowball

<h3><u>Difference b/w Block Storage and Object Storage</u></h3>
<u>Block Storage</u>
-> Block Storage is suitable for transactional databases, random read/write loads and structured database storage.
-> Block Storage divides the data to be stored in evenly sized blocks (data chunck) for instance, a file can be split into evenly sized blocks before it is stored.
-> Data blocks stored in block storage would not contain metadata (data created, data modified, content type etc.)
-> Block Storage only keeps the address (index) where the data blocks are stored, it does not care what is in that block, just how to retrieve it when required.

Example -> EBS 

<u>Object Storage</u>
-> Object Storage stores the file as a whole and does not divide them.
-> In object storage, an object is
   - the file/ data itself
   - its metadata
   - Object Global Unique ID
-> The object Global Unique ID, is a unique identifier for the object (can be the object name itself) and it must be unique such that it can be retrieved disregarding
   where it is physical storage location is.
-> Object storage cannot be mounted as drive

Example -> Dropbox, AWS S3
