<html><h2><u><center>IAM part three</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre>
<h3><u>Permissions and Policies</u></h3>
-> The access management portion of AWS identity and access management (IAM) helps you to define that what a user or other entity is allowed to do in an account, often 
   referred to as authorization.
-> Permissions are granted through policies that are created and then attached to users, groups and roles.

<h3><u>Policies and Users</u></h3>
-> By default, IAM users can't access anything in your account.
-> You grant permissions to a user by creating a policy, which is a document that defines the effect, actions, resource and optional conditions.
-> Any actions or resources that are not explicitly allowed are denied by default. 

<h3><u>IAM Multiple Policies</u></h3>
-> Users or groups can have multiple policies attached to them that grant different permission.
-> In the case of multiple policies attached to a user (or a group), the user's permission are calculated based on the combination of policies.

<h3><u>Federated Users and Roles</u></h3>
-> Federated user don't have permanent identities in your AWS account the way that IAM users do.
-> To assign permissions to federated users you can create an entity referred to as a 'role' and define permission for the role.
-> When a federated user sign-in to AWS, the user is associated with the role and is granted the permission that are defined in the role.

<h3><u>Resource Based Policies</u></h3>
-> In some cases (like S3 bucket), you can attach a policy to a resource in addition to attaching in to a group or user. This is called a Resource Based Policy.
-> A Resource Based Policy contains slightly different information then a user-based Policy.
-> In a Resource Based Policy you specify what actions are permitted and what resources is affected.
-> You also explicitly list who is allowed access to the resource ( a Principal).
-> Resource based policies include a principal element that specifies who is granted the permissions.  

<h3><u>IAM User - The Root User</u></h3>
-> When you first create an AWS account, you create an account (or root user) identity, which you use to sign-in to AWS.
-> The 'account root user' credentials are email address used to create the account and a password, which can be used to sign-in to the AWS management console as the root 
   user.
-> When you sign-in as the root user, you have complete, unrestricted access to all resources in your AWS account, including access to your billing information and ability 
   to change the password.
-> This level of access is necessary when you initially set up the account.
-> It is not possible to restrict the permission that are granted to the AWS account root user.  

<h3><u>AWS recommends that</u></h3>
-> AWS recommends that you don't use root user credentials for everyday access.
-> Also, AWS recommends that you do not share your root user credentials with anyone, because doing so gives them unrestricted access to your account.
-> Create IAM user for yourself and then assign yourself administrative permission for your account.
-> You can then sign-in as that user to add more users as needed.
-> An IAM user with administrator permissions is not the same things as the AWS account root user. 

<h3><u>IAM Users</u></h3>
-> An IAM user is an entity that you can create in AWS. It represents the person or service who uses IAM user to interact with AWS.
-> An IAM user can represent an actual person or an application that requires AWS access to perform action on AWS resources.
-> IAM users are global entities, like an AWS account is today. No region is required to be specified when you define user permission. Users can use AWS services in any 
   Geographical region.

<h3><u>For any user you can assign them </u></h3>
-> A username and password to access the AWS console.
-> An access key (access key ID and secret key) that they use for programmatic access (issuing request) to your AWS services using API and CLI.
-> You assign either or both based on the user activities and needs.
-> You can view and download your secret access key only when you create the access key.
-> You cannot view or recover a secret access key later.
-> If you lose your secret access key, you can create a new access key. 
-> Each IAM user is associated with one AWS account.

<h3><u>By default a new IAM user</u></h3>
-> A new IAM user has no permission to do anything.
-> Has no password and no access key (neither an access key ID nor a secret access key). It means no credentials of any kind.
-> You must create the type of credentials for an IAM user bases on what the user will be doing.
-> You can grant user permissions by attaching IAM policies to them directly or making them members of IAM group where they inherit the group policies and permissions.
-> You can have upto 5000 users per AWS account.
