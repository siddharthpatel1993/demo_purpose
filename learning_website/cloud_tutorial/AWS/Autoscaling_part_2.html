<h4><pre>
-> In four situation, ASG sends a SNS email notification -
1. An instance in launched
2. An instance is terminated
3. An instance is fails to launch
4. An instance fails to terminate

<h3><u>Merging AutoScaling Group</u></h3>
-> Can only be done from the CLI (not AWS console)
-> You can merge single, multiple AZ AutoScaling Group into a single, Multi-AZ autoscaling Group.

-> Scale-out means launching more EC2 instances.
-> Scale-in means terminating one or more EC2 instances by scaling policy.
-> It is always recommended to create a scale-in event for each scale-out event you create.
-> Launch configuration cannot be edited, it can only be copied or deleted.
-> AWS EC2 services send EC2 metrics to cloudwatch about the ASG instances.
   - Basic Monitoring (Every 300 secs enabled by default and free of cost)
   - You can enable detailed monitoring(every 60 secs - chargeable)
-> When the launch configuration is done by AWS CLI, detailed monitoring for EC2 instances is enabled by default.
-> When the launch configuration is done by AWS console, basic monitoring for EC2 instances is enabled by default.

<h3><u>Standby State</u></h3>
-> You can manually move an instance from ASG and put it in standby state.
-> Instances in standby state are still managed by AutoScaling.
-> Instances in standby state are charged as normal, in-service instances.
-> They do not count towards available EC2 instances for workload/APP use.
-> AutoScaling does not perform health check on instances in standby state.

<h3><u>Auto-Scaling Policy</u></h3>
-> There are two types of Scaling Policy - Manual, Dynamic
-> There are three types of Dynamic Scaling - Target Tracking Policy, Simple Scaling Policy, Step Scaling Policy.
-> Define how much you want to scale based on defined conditions.
-> AutoScaling group uses alarms and policies to determine scaling.
-> For simple or step scaling, a scaling adjustment can't change the capacity of the group above the max. group size or below the min. group size.

Predictive Scaling/ Schedule Scaling/ Cyclic Scaling -> It looks at historic pattern and forcast them into the future to schedule change in the no. Of EC2 instances. It 
                                                        uses in Machine Learning model to forecast daily and weekly pattern.

Target Tracking Policies - Increase or decrease the current capacity of the group based on the target value for a specific metric. This is similar to the way that your 
                           thermostat maintain the temperature of your home.  

Step Scaling -> Increase or decrease the current capacity  of the Group based on a set of scaling adjustment, known as step adjustment, that vary based on the size of the 
                alarm breach.
             -> Does not support/ wait for a cool-down timer.
             -> Support a warm-up timer. Time taken by newly launch instance to be ready and contribute to the watched metric.

Simple Scaling -> Single adjustment (up or down) in response to an alarm (cool down timer - 300 sec default). 

Schedule Scaling
-> Use for predictable load change
-> You need to configure a schedule action for a scale out at specific date/time and to a required capacity.
-> A schedule action must have a unique data/time. You cannot config two schedule activities at the same time/date.

What is cool-down period and warm-up period?
