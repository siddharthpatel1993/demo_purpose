<html><h2><u><center>AutoScaling in AWS</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre>
-> Creating group of EC2 instances that can scale up/Scale out or down/scale in depending on conditions you set.
-> Enable Elasticity by scaling horizontally through adding or terminating EC2 instances.
-> AutoScaling ensures that you have the right number of AWS EC2 instances for your needs at all time.
-> AutoScaling helps you save cost by cutting down the number of EC2 instances when not needed, and scaling out to add more instances only when it is required. 
-> AutoScaling is region specific.

<h3><u>AutoScaling Components</u></h3>
<u>1. Launch Configuration</u>
-> Like Instance type, AMI, keypair, Security Group
<u>2. AutoScaling Group</u>
-> Group Name, Group Size, VPC, subnet, Health Check Period
<u>3. Scaling Policy</u>
-> Metric type, Target Value

-> If AutoScaling finds that the number of EC2 instances launched by ASG into subject AZs is not balanced (EC2 instances are not evenly distributed), AutoScaling
   do re-balancing activity of itself.
-> AS always tries to balance the instances distribution across AZs.
-> While re-balancing, ASG launches new EC2 instances where there are less EC2 at present, and then terminates the instances from the AZ, that has more instances.

<h3><u>What causes Imbalance of EC2</u></h3>
-> If we add or remove some subnets/AZ from auto-scaling group.
-> If we manually request for EC2 termination from our ASG.
-> An AZ that did not have enough EC2 capacity now has enough capacity and it is one of our auto-scaling group AZ.   

-> We can attach a running EC2 instances to an ASG by using AWS console or CLI, if the below conditions are met -
   - Instances must be in running state (not terminated or stopped)
   - AMI used to launch the EC2 still Exist
   - Instance is not part of another AutoScaling Group
   - Instance is in the same AZ of the same Group   
   - If the existing EC2 instances under the AutoScaling group, plus the one to be needed, exceed the max. capacity of the AutoScaling Group, the request will
     fail, EC2 instance would not be added. (Exception in balancing with 10% of max or 1).

<h3><u>What happens when you remove EC2, delete AutoScaling</u></h3>
-> You can manually remove EC2 instances from an AutoScaling Group using AWS or CLI.
-> You can then manage the detached instances independently or attach it to another AutoScaling Group.
-> When you detach an instance, you have the option to decrement the AutoScaling Group desired capacity.
   - If you don't, the AutoScaling Group will launch another instance to replace the one detached.
-> When you delete the AutoScaling Group, its parameters like maximum, minimum and desired capacity are all set to Zero. Hence, it terminates all its EC2 instances.
-> If you want to keep the EC2 instances and manage them independently, you can manually detach them first, then delete the ASG.

<h3><u>How ELB will work with ASG</u></h3>
-> We can attach one or more Elastic Load Balancer to our AutoScaling Group.
-> The Elastic Load Balancer must be in the same region as the AutoScaling Group.
-> Once you do this, any EC2 instance existing or added by the AutoScaling Group will be automatically registered with the AutoScaling Group defined ELB.
-> Instances and the ELB must be in the same VPC.

<h3><u>Health-checks on EC2 instances</u></h3>
-> AutoScaling classifies its EC2 instance health status as either healthy or unhealthy.
-> By default, ASG uses EC2 status checks only to determine the health status of an instance.
-> When you have one or more ELB defined with the AutoScaling Group, you can configure AutoScaling to use 'both' (the EC2 health check, and the ELB health check)
   to determine the instances health check.
-> Health check grace period is 300 sec.
-> If we set 'zero' in grace period, then the instance health is checked once it is in service.
-> Until the grace period time expires, any unhealthy status reported by EC2 status check, or the ELB attached to the AutoScaling Group, will not be acted upon. 
-> After Grace period expires, AutoScaling Group would consider an instance unhealthy in any of the following cases -
   - EC2 status check report to AutoScaling Group about an instance status other than running.
   - If ELB health check are configured to be used by the AutoScaling, then if the ELB report the instance as "out of Service".
-> Unlike AZ re-balancing, termination of unhealthy instances happen first, then AutoScaling attempt to launch new instance to replace the ones terminated. 
-> Elastic IP and EBS volumes gets detached from the terminated instances, you need to manually attach them to the new instances.
