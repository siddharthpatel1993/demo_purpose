<html><h2><u><center>AWS Route53</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre> 
-> You can use Amazon Route53 to register new domains, transfer existing domains, route traffic for your domains to your AWS and external resources and monitor the health of 
   your resources.
-> DNS(Domain Name Server) uses TCP port 53, this is why it's called as Route53.  
-> There are two type of top level domains in AWS - Generic Level Domain(.com, .org, .net)  and Geographic Level Domain (.cn, .us, .in).

 <h3><u>Route53 Functions</h3></u>
1. DNS Management
2. Traffic Management
3. Availability Management
4. Domain Registration

<h3><u>Route53 performs three main functions</h3></u>
1. Register a domain.
2. As a DNS, it routes internet traffic to the resources for your domain.
3. Check the health of your resources.
   - Route53 sends automated requests over the internet to a resource (can be a webserver) to verify that the server is reachable, functional and available.
   - Also you can choose to receive notifications when a resource becomes unavailable and choose to route internet traffic away from unhealthy resources.  

-> You can use Route53 for any combination of these functions -
   - You can use route53 both to register your domain and to route internet traffic for the domain.
   - Or, you can use Route53 to route internet traffic for a domain that you registered with other domain registrar.
   
-> When you register a domain with Route53, the service automatically makes itself the DNS service for the domain by doing the following -
   - It creates a hosted zone that has the same name as your domain.
   - It assigns a set of four name servers to the hosted zone, unique to the account.
   - When someone uses a browser to access your website, these name servers inform the browser where to find your resources, such as a web server or an Amazon S3 bucket.
   - It gets the name servers from the hosted zone and add them to the domain.

<h3><u>AWS supports</h3></u>
1. Generic Top Level Domains
2. Geographic Top Level Domains

<h3><u>Registering a domain with Route53</u></h3>
- You can register a domain with Route53, if the TLD is included on the supported TLD list.
- If the TLD is not included, you can't register the domain with Route53.

<u>Using Route53 as your service</u>
-> You can use Route53 as the DNS service for any domain, even if the TLD for the domain is not included on the supported TLD list.

NOTE:- Each Amazon Route53 account is limited to a maximum of 500 hosted zones and 10,000 resource record sets per hosted zone. You can increase the limit by requesting to 
       AWS.

<u>Steps to configure Route53</u>
1. You need to register a domain, this can be Route53 or another DNS registrar, but then you connect your domain name in that registrar to route53.
2. Create hosted zone on Route53, this is done automatically if you registered your domain using Route53.
   - Inside the hosted zone, you need to create record sets.
   
<u>Delegate to Route53</u>
-> This step connects everything and make it work.
-> Connect the domain name to the Route53 hosted zone, this is called delegation.
-> Update your domain registrar with the correct name servers for your Route53 hosted zone.
-> No other customer hosted zone will share this delegation set with you.
-> Doing this means Route53 DNS service will be serving DNS traffic for the domain of the hosted zone.
-> If you registered your domain with a different registrar, you need to configure the Route53 NS servers list in your registrar DNS database for your domain. 

<u>If you are using another domain provider and you did all the changes</u>
-> When you migrate from one DNS provider to another, for an existing domain this change can take upto 48 hours to be effective.
-> This is because name server DNS records are typically cached across the DNS system globally on the internet for upto 48 hours (TTL) periods.

<u>Transferring a domain to Route53</u>
-> You can transfer a domain to Route53 if the TLD is included on the following list.
-> If the TLD is not included, you can't transfer the domain to Route53.
-> For most TLD, you need to get an authorization code from the current registrar to transfer a domain.  

<h3><u>Route53 Hosted Zone</u></h3>
-> A route53 hosted zone is a collection of records for a specified domain.
-> You create a hosted zone for a domain, and then you create records to tell the domain name system how you want traffic to be routed for that domain.
-> Basically a hosted zone is a container that holds information about how you want to route traffic for a domain and its sub-domains.
-> You can create public (internet) hosted zones or private (internal DNS) hosted zones.
-> For each public hosted zone that you create, Amazon Route53 automatically creates a Name Server (NS) record and a Start of Authority (SOA) record. Don't change these 
   records.
-> Route53 automatically creates a Name Server(NS) record with the same name as your hosted zone.
-> It list the four name servers that are the authoritative name servers for your hosted zone.
-> Do not add, change or delete names servers in this record. 
-> When you create a hosted zone, Amazon Route53 automatically creates a Name Server (NS) records and Start of Authority(SOA) record for the zone.
-> The NS record identifies the four name servers that you give to your registrar or your DNS service, so that DNS queries are routed to Route53 name services.
-> By default, Route53 assigns a unique set of four Name Servers (known collectively as a Delegation Set) to each hosted zone that you create.
   eg -> ns-1337.awsdns-39.com
         ns-895.awsdns-47.com
         ns-428.awsdns-53.com
	 ns-1597.awsdns-07.com
		 
<h3><u>Route53 as Authoritative DNS</u></h3>
-> Once you update the Route53 NS settings with your domain registrar to include the Route53 name servers, Route53 will be responsible to respond to DNS queries for the 
   hosted zone.
-> This is true whether you do have a functioning website or not.
-> Route53 will respond with information about the hosted zone whenever someone types the associated domain name in a web browser.
-> You can create more than one hosted zone with the same name and add different records to each hosted zone.
-> Route53 assigns four name servers to every hosted zone.
-> The name servers are different for each of them.
-> When you update your registrar's name server records, be careful to use the Route53 name servers for correct hosted zone, the one that contains the records that you want 
   Route53 to use when responding to queries for your domain.
-> Route53 never returns values for records in other hosted zones that have the same name.

<h3><u>Route53 Hosted Zone default entries</u></h3> 
Inside the hosted zone by default you have two entries -
1. NS Entry - Contains the unique sets of Name Servers for this hosted zone.
2. SOA Entry - Contains information about the hosted zone.
