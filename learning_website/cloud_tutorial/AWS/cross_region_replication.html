<h4><pre>
-> Cross-Region Replication(CRR) enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across buckets in different AWS Regions.
-> Buckets configured for cross-region replication can be owned by the same AWS account or by different accounts.
-> Cross-Region Replication is enabled with a bucket-level configuration. You add the replication configuration to your source bucket.
-> In the minimum configuration, you provide the following -
   - The destination bucket, where you want Amazon S3 to replicate objects
   - An AWS IAM role that Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your behalf
-> Cross Region Replication is a feature that replicates the data from one bucket to another bucket which could be in a different region.
-> It provides asynchronous copying of objects across buckets. Suppose X is a source bucket and Y is a destination bucket. If X wants to copy its objects to Y bucket, then the 
   objects are not copied immediately.
-> Some points to be remembered for Cross Region Replication
   - Create two buckets: Create two buckets within AWS Management Console, where one bucket is a source bucket, and other is a destination bucket.
   - Enable versioning: Cross Region Replication can be implemented only when the versioning of both the buckets is enabled.
   - Amazon S3 encrypts the data in transit across AWS regions using SSL: It also provides security when data traverse across the different regions.
   - Already uploaded objects will not be replicated: If any kind of data already exists in the bucket, then that data will not be replicated when you perform the cross region 
     replication.
-> Use cases of Cross Region Replication
   <u>1. Comply with Compliance Requirements -</u>
      By default, Amazon S3 stores the data across different geographical regions or availability zone to have the availability of data. Sometimes there could be compliance 
      requirements that you want to store the data in some specific region. Cross Region Replication allows you to replicate the data at some specific region to satisfy the 
      requirements. 
   <u>2. Minimize Latency -</u>
      Suppose your customers are in two geographical regions. To minimize latency, you need to maintain the copies of data in AWS region that are geographically closer to your 
      users.
   <u>3. Maintain object copies under different ownership -</u> 
      Regardless of who owns the source bucket, you can tell to Amazon S3 to change the ownership to AWS account user that owns the destination bucket. This is referred to as 
      an owner override option.

Note: 1. All the files in an original bucket are not replicated automatically, and they can be replicated through AWS CLI. All the subsequent files are replicated automatically.
      2. If you upload anything in destination bucket, then it will not upload in the source bucket.
