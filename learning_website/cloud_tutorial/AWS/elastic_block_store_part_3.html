<html><h2><u><center>Encryption of EBS Volume</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre>
-> EBS encryption is supported on all EBS volumes types and all EC2 instance families.
-> Snapshots of encrypted volumes are also encrypted.
-> Creating an EBS volumes from encrypted snapshot will also result it an encrypted volume.
-> Data encryption at rest means, encrypting data while it is stored on the data storage device.
-> Data-in-transit means when the data is moving from EC2 to EBS.
-> There are many ways you can encrypt data on an EBS volume at rest, while the volume is attached to an EC2 instance
   - Use 3rd party EBS Volume
   - Encryption tools
   - Use encrypted EBS volumes  
   - Use encryption at O.S. level
   - Encrypt data at the application level before storing it to the volume
   - Use encrypted file system on the top of the EBS volume.
-> Encrypted volume are accessed exactly like unencrypted ones, basically encryption is handled transparently.
-> You can attach an encrypted and unencrypted volumes to the same EC2 instance. 
-> Encryption always done on EC2 side, not on EBS. 
-> Remember that the EBS volumes are not physically attached to the EC2 instance, rather they are virtually attached through the EBS infrastructure.
-> This means when you encrypt data on an EBS volumes, data is actually encrypted on the EC2 instance then transferred, encrypted to be stored on the EBS volume
-> This means that data in transit between EC2 and encrypted EBS volume is also encrypted.
-> There is no direct way to change the encryption state of the volume (unencrypted to encrypted)
-> To change the state (indirectly) you need to follow either of the following two ways -
   1. Attach a new, encrypted EBS volume to the EC2 instance that has the data to be encrypted then -
      - Mount the new volume to the EC2 instance
      - Copy the data from the unencrypted volume to the new volume
      - Both volumes must be on the same EC2 instance. 
   2. Second Method
      - Create a snapshot of the unencrypted volume
      - copy the snapshot and choose encryption of the new copy, this will create an encrypted copy of the snapshot
      - Use this new copy to create an EBS volume, which will be encrypted too.
      - Attach the new, encrypted EBS volume to the EC2 instance.

<h3><u>Root EBS Volume Encryption</u></h3>
-> You will get option to encrypt the root volume at the launch time.
-> There is no direct way to change the encryption state of a volume.
-> There is an indirect workaround to this -
   - Launch the instance with the EBS volume required
   - Do whatever patching or install application
   - Create an AMI from the EC2 instance
   - Copy the AMI and choose encryption while copying
   - This results it an encrypted AMI that is private (Yours only)
   - Use the encrypted AMI to launch new EC2 instances which will have their EBS root volume encrypted.   

<h3><u>EBS Encryption Key</u></h3>
-> To encrypt a volume or a snapshot you need an encryption key, these keys are called Customer Masters key (CMK) and are managed by AWS key managment service (KMS).
-> When encrypting the first EBS volume, AWS KMS creates a default CMK key. Default CMK key or EBS volume encrypted from it, can't not be sharable to anyone.
-> This key is used for your first volume encryption, Encryption of snapshots created from this volumes and subsequent volumes created from these snapshots.
-> After that each newly encrypted volume is encrypted with a unique/ separate AES-256 bit encryption key. This key is used to encrypt the volume, its snapshots, and any 
   volumes created of its snapshots.

<h3><u>Changing the Encryption Key</u></h3>
-> You cannot change the encryption (CMK) key used to encrypt an existing encrypted snapshot or encrypted EBS volume.
-> If you want to change the key, create a copy of the snapshot and specify during the copy process that you want to re-encrypt the copy with a different key.
-> This comes in handy when you have a snapshot that was encrypted using your default CMK key and you want to change the key in order to be able to share the snapshot
   with other accounts.
   
<h3><u>Sharing EBS Snapshot</u></h3>
-> By default, only the account owner can create volumes from the account snapshots. You have to give the proper permission to others to use the shared snapshots. 
-> You can share your unencrypted snapshots with the AWS community by making them public.
-> Also you can share your unencrypted snapshot with a selected AWS account by making them private then seleting the AWS accounts to share with.
-> You can not make your encrypted snapshots public.
-> You cannot make a snapshot of an encrypted EBS volume public on AWS.    
-> You can share your encrypted snapshot with specific AWS accounts as follows -
-> Make sure that you use a non-default/ custom CMK key to encrypt the snapshot, not the default CMK key (AWS will not allow the sharing if default CMK is used)
-> Configure cross account Permission in order to give the accounts(s) with which you want to share the snapshot, access to the custom CMK key used to encrypt the 
   snapshot.
-> Without this, the other accounts will not be able to copy the snapshot, nor will be able to create volumes of the snapshot.
-> AWS will not allow you to share snapshots encrypted using your default CMK key.
-> For the AWS account(s) with whom an encrypted snapshot is shared -
   - They must first create their own copies of the snapshot and change the key
   - Then they use that copy to restore/ create EBS volume.    
-> You can only make a copy of the snapshot when it has been fully saved to S3 (its status show as complete) and not during the snapshot's pending status (when data blocks)
   are being moved to S3).
-> Amazon S3 server side encryption (SSE) protect the snapshot data-in-transit while copying.
-> You can have upto 5 snapshot copy request running in a single destination per account.
