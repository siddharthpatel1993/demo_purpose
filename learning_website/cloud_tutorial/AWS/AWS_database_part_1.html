<html><h2><u><center>AWS Database - Introduction</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre> 
<h3><u>What is Data?</u></h3>
-> In simple words, data can be facts related to any object.
-> For eg. your age, job, house no, contact no, name, place are some data related to you.

<h3><u>What is Database?</u></h3>
-> Database is a systematic collection of data.
-> Databases support storage and manipulation of data.
-> Eg - Facebook, Telecom companies, Amazon.com

<h3><u>What is DBMS?</u></h3>
-> DBMS is a collection of programs which enable its users to access database, manipulate data, reporting/ representation of data.
-> Types of DBMS
   - Hierarchical
   - Network
   - Relational
   - Object Oriented   
   
<h3><u>Relational Database/SQL</u></h3>
-> A Relational Database is a data structure that allows you to link information from different 'tables' or different types of data bucket.
-> Tables are related to each other.
-> All fields must be field.
-> Best suited for OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)
-> Relational DB - MySQL, Oracle DBMS, IBM DB2
-> A row of a table is also called Record. It contains the specific information of each individual entry in the table.
-> Each table has its own Primary Key.
-> A schema (Design of a database) is used to strictly defines, tables, column, indexes and relation between tables.
-> Relational DB are usually used in Enterprises application/scenario.
-> Exception in MySQL which is used for web application.
-> Common application for MySQL include php and java based web applications that requires a database storage backend. (Eg -> JOOMLA)
-> Cannot scale-out horizontally.
-> Virtually all Relational DB uses SQL.

<h3><u>Non-Relational Database/NoSQL (Not only Structure Query Language)</u></h3>
-> Non-Relational Databases store data without a structured mechanism to link data from different tables to one another.
-> Require low cost hardware.
-> Much faster performance (Read/Write) compared to Relational DBs.
-> Never provide table with flat fixed column records. It means schema-free.
-> Best suited for Online Analytical Processing (Data warehouse).
-> Eg of Nosql databases - MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB, Pastegre, Raven, Redis etc.

<u> Types of No-SQL Databases</u>
1. Columnar Database (Cassandra, HBase)
2. Document Database (MongoDB, CouchDB, RavenDB)
3. Key-Value Database (Redis, Riak, DynamoDB, TokyoCabinet)
4. Graph Based Database (Neo4J, FlockDBB) 

<u>Columnar Database</u>
-> A Columnar database is a DBMS that stores data in columns instead of rows.
-> In a Columnar DB, all the column1 values are physically together, followed by all the column2 values.
-> In a row oriented DBMS, the data would be stored like this, (1,Bob, 30, 8000; 2, Avan, 26, 4000; 3, Vian, 39, 2000)
-> In a column based DBMS, the database would be stored like this, (1,2,3; Bob, Avan, Vian; 30, 26, 39; 8000, 4000, 2000)
-> Benefit is that because, column based DBMS is self indexing, it uses less disk space that a RDBMS containing the same data.
-> It easily perform operation like min, max and Avg.

<u>Document Database</u>
-> Document DB make it easier for developers to store and querying data in a DB by using the same document model format they use in their application code.
-> Document DBs are efficient for storing catalog.
-> Store semi-structure data as document typically in JSON or XML format.
-> In the following example, A JSON like document describe a book.
[
{ "year": 2010,
  "title": "AWS Fundamentals",
  "info": {
		"Write": ["Siddharth", "Sachin"]
		"release date": "2020-01-07",
		"rating": 6.2;
		"genre": "Cloud"
	      }
}
] 

-> A document database is a great choice for contain management application such as blogs and video platforms.

<u>Key-Value Database</u>
-> A key-Value DB is a simple DB that uses an associative array (think of a dictionary) as a fundamental model where each key is associated with one and only one value in a 
   collection.
-> It allows horizontal Scaling.
-> Use cases - Shopping cart and session store in app like FB and twitter.
-> This improves application performance by storing critical pieces of data in-memory for low latency access.
-> Amazon Elasticache as an in-memory key-value stores. 

<u>Graph Based Database</u>
-> A graph based DB is basically a collection of Nodes and edges. Each node represent an entity (like person) and each edge represent a connection or relationship between 
   two nodes.
