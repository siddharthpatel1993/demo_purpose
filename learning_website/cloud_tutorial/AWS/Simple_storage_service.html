<html><h2><u><center>Simple Storage Service</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre>
-> S3 is a storage for the internet. It has a simple web service interface for the simple storing and retrieving of any amount of data, anytime from anywhere on the internet.
-> S3 is a object based storage.
-> You cannot install operating system on S3.
-> S3 has a distributed data-store architecture where objects are redundantly stored in multiple locations (min 3 locations in same region)
-> Data is stored in Bucket.
-> A bucket is a flat container of objects.
-> Max. capacity of a bucket is 5 TB.
-> You can create folders in your bucket (available through console)
-> You cannot create nested buckets.
-> Bucket ownership is Non-transferable.
-> S3 bucket is a region specific.
-> You can have upto 100 buckets per account (May expand on request) 

<h3><u>S3 Buckets - Naming Rules</u></h3>
-> S3 Bucket names(keys) are globally unique across all AWS regions.
-> Bucket names cannot be changed after they are created.
-> If a bucket is deleted, its name becomes available again to you or other account to use.
-> Bucket names must be at least 3 and no more than 63 characters long.
-> Bucket names are part of the URL used to access buckets.
-> Bucket name must be a series of one or more labels (xyz.bucket)
-> Bucket names can contain lowercase, numbers and hyphen. Cannot use uppercase letter.
-> Bucket name should not be an IP address (10.10.20.20)
-> Each lable must start and end with a lowercase letter or a number i.e. you cannot start or end the bucket name with hyphen. 
-> By default, bucket and its objects are private. By default, only owner can access the bucket. 

Note: The name is simply two parts - Bucket region's endpoint and bucket name
For example - For S3 bucket named mybucket in Europe West Region
-> https://s3-eu-west1.amazonaws.com/mybucket 

<h3><u>S3 Buckets - Sub resources</u></h3>
Sub-resources for S3 bucket includes -
1. Life-cycle - To decide on object's life-cycle management
2. Website - To hold configurations related to static website hosted in S3 bucket.
3. Versioning - Keep object versions as it changes (get updated). You can enable or suspend it, but cannot disable it.
4. Access Control List - Bucket Policies

<h3><u>S3 Objects</u></h3>
-> An object size stored in an S3 bucket can be 0 byte to 5 TB.
-> Each object is stored and retrieved by a unique key (ID or name)
-> An object is AWS S3 is uniquely identified and addressed through
   - Service endpoint
   - Bucket name
   - Object key (name)
   - Optionally Object Version
-> Object stored in a s3 bucket in a region will never leave that region unless you specifically move them to another region or CRR
-> A Bucket owner can grant cross-account permission to another AWS account (or users in another account) to upload objects.
-> You can grant S3 bucket/ object permission to -
   - Individual User
   - AWS Account
   - Make the resource public
   - Or to all authenticate user
   
<h3><u>S3 Bucket Versioning</u></h3>
-> Bucket Versioning is a S3 Bucket sub-resource used to protect against accidental object/data deleting and overwrite.
-> Versioning can also be used for data retention and archive.
-> Once you enable versioning on a bucket, it cannot be disabled, however it can be suspended.
-> When enabled, Bucket Versioning will protect existing and new objects, and maintain their versions as thay updated.
-> Updating objects refers to PUT, POST, COPY. DELETE actions on objects.
-> When versioning is enabled, and you try to delete an object, a delete marker is placed on the object.
   - You can still view the object and the delete marker.
-> If you reconsider deleting the objects, you can delete the "Delete Marker" and the object will be available again.
-> You will be charged for all S3 storage cost for all object versions stored.
-> You can use versioning with S3 lifecycle policies to delete older versions, or you can move them to a cheaper S3 storage (or Glacier).
-> Bucket Versioning state -
   - Enabled
   - Suspended
   - Un-versioned
-> Versioning applies to all objects in a bucket and not partially applied.
-> Object existing before enabling versioning will have a version id or "NULL".
-> If you have a bucket that is already versioned then you suspend versioning, existing objects and their versions remain as it is.
-> However, they will not be updated/versioned further with future updates while the bucket versioning is suspended.
-> New objects (uploaded after suspension) they will have a version ID "null". If the same key (name) is used to store another objects, then it will override the existing one.
-> An object deletion in a suspended versioning buckets, will only delete the objects with ID "null".  

<h3><u>S3 Bucket Versioning - MFA Delete</u></h3>
-> Multifactor authentication delete is a versioning capacity that adds another level of security in case your account is compromised.
-> This adds another level of security for the following -
   - Changing your bucket's versioning state
   - Permanently deleting an object version
-> MFA Delete requires -
   - Your security credentials
   - The code displayed on an approved physical or s/w based authentication device.  

<h3><u>S3 Multipart Upload</u></h3>
-> It is used to upload an object in parts.
-> Parts are uploaded independently and in parallel, in any order.
-> It is recommended for objects sizes of 100 MB or larger.
-> You must use it for the objects larger than 5 GB.
-> This is done through S3 Multipart Upload API.   

<h3><u>Copying S3 Objects</u></h3>
-> The copy operation creates a copy of an object that is alreday stored in Amazon S3.
-> You can create a copy of your object upto 5 GB in size in a single atomic operation.
-> However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB , you must use the multipart upload API.
-> Incur charges, if copy to another region.
-> Use the copy operation to -
   - Generate additional copies of the subject
   - Renaming object (copy to a new name)
   - Changing the copy's storage class or encrypt it at rest
   - Move object across AWS Location/ Region
   - Change object metadata
