<h4><pre> 
<h3><u>Types of Data</h3></u>
-> Unstructured data is information that either does not have a pre-defined data model or is not organized in a pre-defined manner.
-> Unstructured information is typically text-heavy, but may contain data such as dates, numbers and facts as well examples include e-mail, messages, word processing 
   documents, videos, photos, audio files, presentations webpages.
-> Semi-structured data is information that does not reside in a relational database but that does have some organizational properties that make it easier to analyze. 
   (eg -> XML & JSON)  
-> Structured data refers to information with a high degree of organization, such that inclusion in a relational database is seamless and readily searchable by simple, 
   straightforward search engine algorithms or other search operations.
-> All data which can be stored in database SQL in table with rows and columns. They have relational key and can be easily mapped into pre-defined fields.

<h3><u>Dynamo DB Table</h3></u>
-> A table is a collection of data items.
-> Like all other DB, dynamoDB stores data in tables.

<u>Items</u>
-> Each table contains multiple items.
-> An item, is a group of attributes that is uniquely identifiable among all of the other items.
-> An item consist of a primary or composite key and a flexible number of attributes.
-> Items in DynamoDB are similar into Rows, Records in other DB.

<u>Attributes</u>
-> Each item is composed of one or more attributes.
-> An attribute consist of the attribute name and value or set of values.
-> An attribute is a fundamental data element, something that does not need to be broken down any further.

Note: Aggregate size of an item cannot exceed 400KB including key and all attributes.
      If it is more than 400KB then it has to copy in S3 and URL of s3 has to be stored in the item.
	  
-> DynamoDB allows low latency read/write access to items ranging from 1 byte to 400KB.
-> DynamoDB can be used to store pointers to S3 stored objects, or items of sizes larger than 400kb too if needed.
-> DynamoDB stored data indexed by a primary key. You specify the primary key when you create the table.
-> Each item in the table has a unique identifier, or primary key, that distinguishes the item from all of the others in the table.  
-> The primary key is the only required attributes for items in the table.
-> DynamoDB tables are schema-less, which means that neither the attributes nor their data types need to be defined beforehead.
-> Each item can have its own distinct attributes.	  

<h3><u>Read Capacity Unit</u></h3>
-> One read capacity unit represents one strongly consistent read per second, or two eventually consistent reads per seconds for an item upto 4kb in size.
-> If you need to read an item that is larger than 4kb, DynamoDB will need to consume additional read capacity units.
-> The total number of read capacity units required depends on item size, and whether you want an eventually consistent or strongly consistent read.

<h3><u>Write Capacity Unit</u></h3>
-> One write capacity unit represents one write per second for an item upto 1kb in size.
-> If you need to write an item that is larger than 1kb, DynamoDB will need to consume additional write capacity units.
-> The total number of write capacity units required depends on the item size.

<h3><u>DynamoDB - Pricing</u></h3>
-> Read are cheaper than writes when using DynamoDB.
-> You pay for -
   - Each table's provisioned read/write throughput (Hourly Rates)
   - You are charged for provisioned throughput regardless whether you use it or not.
   - Indexed data storage.
   - Internet data transfer (if crosses a region)
   - Free tier per account (across all tables) of 25 read capacity units and 25 write capacity units per month.   
-> DynamoDB can do 10,000 write capacity units/sec, or 10,000 Read capacity units per second per table.

<h3><u>DynamoDB Limits</u></h3>   
-> 256 tables per account per region.
-> No limits on the size of any table.
