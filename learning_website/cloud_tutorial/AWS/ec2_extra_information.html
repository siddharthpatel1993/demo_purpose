<html><h2><u><center>EC2 Access, Status Check and EC2 Meta Data</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre>  
<h3><u>EC2 Access -</u></h3>
-> To access instances, you need a key and key pair Name.
-> You can download the private key only once.
-> The public key is saved by AWS to match it to the key pair Name and private key when you try to login to the EC2 instances.
-> Without key pair you cannot access instances via RDP or SSH.
-> There is 20 EC2 instances soft limit per region, you can submit a request to AWS to increase it. 

<h3><u>EC2 Status Check -</u></h3>
-> By default AWS EC2 service performs automated status checks every one minute.
-> This is done on every running EC2 instances to identify any H/W or software issue.
-> Status check is inbuilt into the AWS EC2 instance.
-> They cannot be configured, deleted or disable.
-> EC2 services can send its metric data to AWS cloudwatch every 5 minutes (enabled by default).
-> Detailed monitoring is chargeable which sends metric in every 1 minute.
-> You are not charged for EC2 instances, if they are stopped, however attached EBS volumes incur charges. 

Note: 1. EBS Backed EC2 instance means the root volume of EC2 instance where O.S has been placed is EBS.
      2. Instance Store Backed EC2 means the root volume of EC2 instance is Instance Store.

<h3><u>When you stop an EBS Backed EC2 instance</u></h3>
-> Instances perform a shutdown.
-> State changes from "Running" to "Stopping".
-> EBS Volumes remain attached to the instance.
-> Any data cached in RAM or instance store volume is gone.
-> Instances retain its private IPv4 or any IPv6 address.
-> Instances release its public IPv4 address back to AWS pool because public IP is dynamic.
-> Instances retain its Elastic IP address. It is public IP and static IP address which never changes. 

<h3><u>EC2 Termination</u></h3>
-> When you terminate a running instance the instance state changes from "Running" to "Shutting Down" to "Terminated".
-> During the shutdown down and terminated state, you do not incur charges.
-> By default, EBS Root Devices volumes are deleted automatically when the EC2 instances are terminated.
-> Any additional (non boot/boot) volumes, attached to the instances by default, persist after the instance is terminated.
-> That means the root volume only will be get deleted by default, the additional volume will still there after termination.
-> You can modify both behaviors by modifying the 'Delete on Termination' attribute of any EBS Volumes during instances launch or while running.
-> Enable 'EC2 Termination Protection' against accidental termination.   

<h3><u>EC2 Metadata</u></h3>
-> The is instance data that you can use to configure or manage the instance.
   eg -> IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses, DNS hostname, AMI-id, Instance ID, Instance Type, local hostname, public keys, security groups.
-> Metadata can be only viewed from within the instance itself i.e. you have to login to the instance.
-> Metadata is not protected by encryption, anyone that has access to the instance can view the data.
-> To view the instance metadata, GET http://169.254.169.254/latest/Metadata 

<h3><u>Instances User Data</u></h3>
-> Data supplied by the user at the instance launch in the form of a script to be executed during the instance boot.
-> User data is limited to 16 KB.
-> You can change user data by stopping EC2 first.
-> User data is not encrypted.

<h3><u>EC2 Bare Metal Instances</u></h3>
-> Non virtualized Environment.
-> Operating System runs directly on Hardware.
-> Suitable for Licensing Restricted tier-1 business critical application.
-> i3 metal, i5-metal,r-5 metal, Z1d metal, U-6tb1 metal are some examples.
-> If metal is placed in the instance type, then it is Bare metal example.

<h3><u>Elastic Block Storage</u></h3>
-> Most common replicate with A-Z.
-> EBS volumes attach at launch and delete when instance terminate by default, unless you uncheck the box.
-> EBS volumes attached to a running instance are not deleted when instance is terminated but are detached with data interact.
-> If you have used EBS volume as root volume for an instance then it will be called as EBS backed instance. 
-> It is Network Attached Storage (NAS), It is slower than Instance Storage.

<h3><u>Instance Storage</u></h3>
-> Physically attach to the host server.
-> Data not lost when OS is rebooted.
-> Data lost when -
   1. Underlying driver fails
   2. Instance is stopped or terminated.
-> You can't detach or attach to another instance.
-> Do not rely on for valuable long term data.
-> It is Direct Attached Storage (DAS), it is faster than EBS.
