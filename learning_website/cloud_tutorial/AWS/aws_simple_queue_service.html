<html><h2><u><center>AWS Simple Queue Service</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre> 
-> SQS is a fast, reliable, fully managed message queue service.
-> It is a web service that gives you access to message queues that store messages waiting to be processed.
-> It offers a reliable, highly scalable, hosted queue for storing messages  between servers.
-> It allows the decoupling of application components such that a failure in one components does not cause a bigger problem to application functionality (like in coupled app) 
-> Using SQS, you no longer need a highly available message cluster or the burden of running it.
-> You can delete all the messages in an SQS queue without the SQS queue itself.
-> You can use applications on EC2 instances to read and process the SQS queue messages.
-> You can use auto-scaling to scale the EC2 fleet processing the SQS messages, as the queue size increases.
-> These applications on EC2 instances can process the SQS messages/jobs then post the results to other SQS queues or the AWS service. 
-> SQS is a pull service whereas SNS is push service.

<h3><u>AWS Queue Types</u></h3>
1. Standard Queue
-> High(unlimited) throughput
-> At least one delivery 
-> Duplicacy is possible.
-> Best effort ordering

2. FIFO Queue
-> Limited throughput(300 TPS)
-> Exactly one processing
-> Duplicacy not possible
-> Strict ordering (First in First out)
-> FIFO queues are limited to 300 transactions per seconds(TPS), but have all the capabilities of standard queue.

<h3><u>SQS Pricing</u></h3>
-> The first 1 million monthly requests are free, after that pricing is according to regions.
-> For eg - in Mumbai region
   standard queue - $0.40/million request
   FIFO queue - $0.50/million request
   
<h3><u>How Amazon SQS Charges</u></h3>
-> API Action - Every Amazon SQS action count as a request
-> FIFO Request - API actions for sending, receiving, deleting and changing visibility of messages from FIFO queues are charged at FIFO rates. 
-> Contents of Requests - A single request can have from 1 to 10 messages, upto maximum total payload of 256kb.
-> Size of payload - Each 64kb chunk of a payload is billed as 1 request ( For eg - API action with 256kb payload is billed as 4 request).
-> Interaction with Amazon S3.
-> Interaction with AWS KMS.

<h3><u>Short Polling</u></h3>
-> A request is returned immediately even if the queue is empty.
-> It does not wait for messages to appear in the queue.
-> It queries only a subset of the available servers for messages (based on weighted random distribution).
-> Default by SQS.
-> ReceiveMessageWaittime is set to 0.
-> More request are used, which implies higher cost.

<h3><u>Long Polling</u></h3> 
-> Is preferred to regular/short polling. It uses fewer requests and request cost by -
   - Eliminating false empty responses by querying all the servers.
   - Reduce the number of empty responses, by allowing amazon SQS to wait until a message is available in the queue before sending a response, unless the connection 
     timeout(20sec).
-> ReceiveMessageWaittime is set to a non-zero value(max 20 seconds).
-> Billing is same for both pollings.

<h3><u>SQS - Retention Period</u></h3>
-> SQS messages can remain in the queue for upto 14 days (SQS retention period).
-> Range is 1 minute to 14 days(Default is 4 days).
-> Once the maximum retention period of a message is reached, it will be deleted automatically from the queue.
-> SQS can be used with DynamoDB, EC2, ECS, Redshift, RDS, Lambda, S3 to make distributed/decoupled applications.
-> You can have multiple queues with different priorities.

<h3><u>SQS - Visibility Timeout</u></h3>    
-> Is the duration of a time a message is locked for read by others servers.
-> Max is 12 hours and default is 30 seconds.
-> A server that read a message to process it, can change the message visibility timeout if it needs more time to process the message.
-> After a message is read, there are the following possibilities:
   1. An ACK is received that a message is processed, so it must be deleted from the queue to avoid duplicates.
   2. If a fail is received or the visibility timeout expires, the message will then be unlocked for read, such that it can be read and processed by another servers.
   
<h3><u>Delivery Delay</u></h3>     
-> AWS SQS provides delivery delay options to postpone the delivery of new messages to queue if delivery delay is defined for a queue.
-> Any new messages will not be visible to the server for the duration of the delay.    
-> The default (min.) delay for a queue is 0 seconds. 
-> The maximum is 15 minutes.

<h3><u>ReceiveMessageWaittime</u></h3>  
-> The default time is 0 seconds.
-> The maximum amount of time that a long polling receive call will wait for a message to become available before returning an empty response(max value is 20 seconds).

<h3><u>Dead Letter Queue</u></h3>   
-> The main task of a dead letter queue is handling message failure.
-> A dead letter queue lets you set aside and isolate messages that can't be processed correctly to determine why their processing didn't succeed.
-> Don't use a dead letter queue with a FIFO queue, if you don't want to break the exact order of messages or operations.
-> DLQ must be of the same type as the source queue(standard or FIFO).
