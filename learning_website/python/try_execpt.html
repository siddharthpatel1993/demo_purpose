<html><h2><u><center>Try and Except</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre>
-> The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.
-> The except block lets you handle the error.
-> The finally block lets you execute the code, regardless of the result of the try and except blocks.

<h2><u>Exception Handling</u></h2>
-> When an error occurs, or exception as we call it, Python will normally stop and generate an error message.
-> These exceptions can be handled using the try statement.
-> Since the try block raises an error, the except block will be executed. Without the try block, the program will crash and raise an error. 

Example ->
#The try block will generate an error, because x is not defined:
try:
  print(x)
except:
  print("An exception occurred")

<h2><u>Many Exceptions -</u></h2>
You can define as many exception blocks you want, e.g. if you want to execute a special block of code for a special kind of error.

Example -> Print one message if the try block raises a NameError and another for other errors.

try:
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = a + b
    print(c)
except NameError:
  print("Variable x is not defined")
except Exception as e:
  print(e)

<h2><u>Else -</u></h2>
You can use the else keyword to define a block of code to be executed if no errors were raised.

Example ->

try:
  print("Hello")
except:
  print("Something went wrong")
else:
  print("Nothing went wrong")

<h2><u>Finally -</u></h2>
-> The finally block, if specified, will be executed regardless if the try block raises an error or not.

Example -> 

try:
  print(x)
except:
  print("Something went wrong")
finally:
  print("The 'try except' is finished")

-> This can be useful to close objects and clean up resources.
-> The program can continue, without leaving the file object open.

Example ->

try:
  f = open("demofile.txt")
  f.write("Lorum Ipsum")
except:
  print("Something went wrong when writing to the file")
finally:
  f.close()

<h2><u>Raise an exception -</u></h2>
-> As a python developer, you can choose to throw an exception if a condition occurs.
-> To throw (or raise) an exception, use the raise keyword.

Example -> Raise an error and stop the program if x is lower than 0.

x = -1

if x < 0:
  raise Exception("Sorry, no numbers below zero")

-> You can define what kind of error to raise, and the text to print to the user.

Example -> Raise a TypeError if x is not an integer.

x = "hello"

if not type(x) is int:
  raise TypeError("Only integers are allowed")
