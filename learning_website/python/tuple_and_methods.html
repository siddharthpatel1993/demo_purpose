<html><h3><u> Tuple </u></h3>

<pre>Tuples in Python:

<mark>Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.</mark> 

a=()    # It's an example of empty tuple

x=(1,)  # Tuple with single value i.e. 1

tup1 = (1,2,3,4,5)

tup2 = ('sidd', 5, 'demo' 5.8)

<mark>Note: To create a tuple of one element it is necessary to put a comma  ‘,’ after that one element like this tup=(1,) because if we have only 1 element inside the parenthesis, 
the python interpreter will interpret it as a single entity which is why it’s important to use a ‘,’ after the element while creating tuples of a single element. </mark>
