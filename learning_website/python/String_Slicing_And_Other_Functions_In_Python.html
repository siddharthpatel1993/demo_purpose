<h3><u>Strings</u></h3>
String is a data type in Python. Strings in Python programming language are arrays of bytes representing a sequence of characters. In simple terms, Strings are the combination
or collection of characters enclosed in quotes.

Primarily, you will find 3 types of strings in Python:
•	Single Quote String – (‘Single Quote String’)
•	Double Quote String – (“Double Quote String”)
•	Triple Quote String – (‘’’ Triple Quote String ‘’’)

Let us now look into some functions you will use to manipulate or perform operations on strings.

<u>len() Function</u> : This len() function returns the total no. of characters in a string. E.g. for string a="abc", len(a) will return 3 as the output as it is a string 
variable containing 3 characters

Strings are one of the most used data types in any programming language because most of the real-world data such as name, address, or any sequence which contains alphanumeric 
characters are mostly of type ‘String’.

E.g. Consider this string variable x
x = "String Demo"

This string variable x contains a string containing 11 characters (including spaces). Since the index in a string starts from 0 to length-1, this string can be looked at as:

<mark>Note: The indexes of a string begin from 0 to (length-1) in the forward direction and -1,-2,-3,…, -length in the backward direction. </mark>

<u>String Slicing:</u>

As we know the meaning of the word ‘slice’ is ‘a part of’. I am sure you have sliced paneer cubes at home!
Just like paneer slice refers to the part of the paneer cube; In Python, the term ‘string slice’ refers to a part of the string, where strings are sliced using a range
of indices. To do string slicing we just need to put the name of the string followed by [n:m]. It means ‘n’ denotes the index from which slicing should start and ‘m’ denotes 
the index at which slicing should terminate or complete. Let's look into an example!
 
<img src="picture/string_slicing2.JPG" alt="pic1" style="width:1000px;height:350px;">
 
In Python, string slicing s[n:m] for a string s is done as characters of s from n to m-1. It means characters are taken from the first index to second index-1.
For E.g. abc="Demo" then abc[0:3] will give ‘Dem’ and will not give ‘Demo’ coz index number of ‘D’ is 0, ‘e’ is 1, ‘m’ is 2, and ‘o’ is 3. So, it will give a range from n to 
m-1 i.e. 0 to 3-1=2. That’s why we got output ‘Dem’.

In string slicing, we sometimes need to give a skip value i.e. string[n:m:skip_value]. This simply takes every skip_valueth character. By default, the skip value is 1 but if 
we want to choose alternate characters of a string then we can give it as 2. Have a look at the example below:

Let's end this tutorial by looking into some of the most used string functions:
•	string.endswith(): This function allows the user to check whether a given string ends with passed argument or not. It returns True or False.
  
•  	string.count(): This function counts the total no. of occurrence of any character in the string. It takes the character whose occurrence you want to find as an 
                        argument.

•	string.capitalize(): This function capitalizes the first character of any string. It doesn’t take any argument.

•	string.upper(): It returns the copy of the string converted to the uppercase.

•	string.lower(): It returns the copy of the string converted to lower case.

•	string.find(): This function finds any given character or word in the entire string. It returns the index of first character from that word.

•	string.replace(“old_word”, “new_word”): This function replaces the old word or character with a new word or character in the entire string.

#String Functions :

demo = " Aakash is a good boy"

print(demo.endswith("boy"))

print(demo.count('o'))

print(demo.capitalize())

print(demo.upper())

print(demo.lower())

print(demo.find("is"))

print(demo.replace("good","nice"))

 
 
<u>Program</u>
mystr = "Mohan is a good boy"
# print(len(mystr))
# print(mystr[::-2])

print(mystr.endswith("bdoy"))
print(mystr.count("o"))
print(mystr.capitalize())
print(mystr.replace("is", "are"))
