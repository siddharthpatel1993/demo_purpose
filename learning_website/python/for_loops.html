<html><h4><pre><u><center>For Loops In Python</center></u>

For loop is also just a programming function that iterates a statement or a number of statements based on specific boundaries under certain defined conditions, that are the 
basis of the loop.

Why do we use loops?
•	Complex problems can be simplified using loops
•	Less amount of code required for our program
•	Lesser code so lesser chance of error
•	Saves a lot of time
•	Can write code that is practically impossible to be written
•	Programs that require too many iterations such as searching and sorting algorithms can be simplified using loops

Advantages of loops:
•	The reusability of code is ensured
•	We do not have to repeat the code again and again, just have to write it one time
•	We can transverse through data structures like list, dictionary, and tuple
•	We apply most of the finding algorithms through loops



Program:

# list1 = [ ["Harry", 1], ["Larry", 2],
#           ["Carry", 6], ["Marie", 250]]
# dict1 = dict(list1)
#
# for item in dict1:
#     print(item)
# for item, lollypop in dict1.items():
#     print(item, "and lolly is ", lollypop)
items = [int, float, "HaERRY", 5,3, 3, 22, 21, 64, 23, 233, 23, 6]

for item in items:
    if str(item).isnumeric() and item>=6:
        print(item)

# Increment the sequence with 3 (default is 1):

for x in range(2, 30, 3):
  print(x)

# Print all numbers from 0 to 5, and print a message when the loop has ended:

for x in range(6):
  print(x)
else:
  print("Finally finished!")

#Nested Loop

adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for x in adj:
  for y in fruits:
    print(x, y)

# Pass statement


for x in [0, 1, 2]:
  pass
