<html><h2><u><center>Sets In Python</center></u></h2>

<h4><pre>A set is a collection of well-defined objects and non-repetitive elements that is - a set with 1,2,3,4,3,4,5,2, 2, and 3 as its elements can be written as {1,2,3,4,5}.
<mark>No repetition of elements is allowed in sets.</mark>

In Python programming, sets are more or less the same. Let's look at the Python programming definition of sets:

“A set is a data structure, having unordered, unique, and unindexed elements.”

Elements in a set are also called entries and no two entries could be the same within a set.


If you want to use sets in your python programs, you should know the following  properties of sets in Python:
•	Sets are iterable(iterations can be performed using loops)
•	They are mutable (can be updated by adding or removing entries)
•	There is no duplication (two same entries do not occur)

Structure:
•	Elements of the sets are written in between two curly brackets and are separated with a comma, and in this simple way, we can create a set in Python.
•	The other way of forming a set is by using a built-in set constructor function.


Let me now share some basic information about sets so you know why they are so important and why should you learn them. 

Unlike the dictionary (that we have learned already), sets are not just restricted to Python language, but nearly all commonly used programming languages have sets included in
them as a data type. Examples of these languages include C++, Java, etc., even languages such as Swift and JavaScript support sets. One of the earliest languages that 
supported sets was Pascal. I hope you now have a rough idea around how important these sets actually are because whichever language you choose to code in, you must have a very 
basic understanding of sets!

Restrictions:
Everything has a limit to its functionality, there are some limitations on working with sets too.
•	<mark>Once a set is created, you cannot change any of its items, although you can add new items or remove previous but updating an already existing item is not possible.</mark>
•	There is no indexing in sets, so accessing an item in order or through a key is not possible, although we can ask the program if the specific keyword we are looking 
        for is present in the set by using “in” keyword or by looping through the set by using a for loop.

Despite these restrictions, sets play a very important role in the life of a python programmer. In most cases, these restrictions are never a problem for the programmer given 
he knows which data type to use when. And this skill is something you will learn with time after writing a lot of python programs

Program

s = set()
# print(type(s))
# l = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# s_from_list = set(l)
# print(s_from_list)
# print(type(s_from_list))
s.add(1)
s.add(2)
s.remove(2)
s1 = {4, 6}
print(s.isdisjoint(s1))
