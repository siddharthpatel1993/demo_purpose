<html><h3><u>Variable-:</u></h3>
<h4><pre>A variable is a name given to any storage area or memory location in a program. In simple words, we can say that a variable is a container that contains some 
information, and whenever we need that information, we use the name of that container to access it. 

Let's create a variable:
a=34 #variable storing an integer
b=23.2 #variable storing real number

Here a and b are variables, and we can use a to access 34 and b to access 23.2. We can also overwrite the values in a and b

<u>Data Types in Python</u> - Primarily there are following data types in Python.
1.	Integers (<class 'int'>): Used to store integers
2.	Floating point numbers (<class 'float'>): Used to store decimal or floating-point numbers
3.	Strings (<class 'str'>): Used to store strings
4.	Booleans (<class 'bool'>): Used to store True/False type values
5.	None: None is a literal to describe 'Nothing' in Python 

Rules for defining a variable in Python:
•	A variable name can contain alphabets, digits, and underscores (_). For E.g.: demo_xyz = ‘It’s a string variable’
•	A variable name can only start with an alphabet and underscore.
•	It can't start with a digit. 5sidd is illegal and not allowed
•	No white-space is allowed to be used inside a variable name.
•	Also, reserved keywords are not recommended to be used as variable names.
Examples of few valid variable names are sidd, _demo, de_mo, etc.

Python is a fantastic language that automatically identifies the type of data for us. It means we need to put some data in a variable, and Python automatically understands the 
kind of data a variable is holding. Cool, isn't it?
Have a look at the code below:
 
<code>
#Variable in Python:
abc = "It's a string variable"
_abcnum = 40 # It is an example of int variable
abc123 = 55.854 #It is anexample of float variable
print(_abcnum+abc123) #This will give sum of 40+55.854
</code>
<mark><u>type() Function in Python:</u> type() function is a function that allows a user to find data type of any variable. It returns the data type of any data contained in 
the variable passed to it. </mark>
Have a look at the code below which depicts the use of type function:
 
# type() Function in Python:

sidd = "40"

demo = 55.5

demo2 = 40

print(type(sidd))         #It will give output as string type

demo3 = type(demo)        #It will return data type as float
print(demo3)              #It will print that data type

print(type(demo2))        #It will give output as int type
 
<mark>Note – We can't do arithmetic operations of numbers with strings i.e. we can't add a string to any number. Have a look at the example below: </mark>

var1 = "It's a String"

var2 = 5

print(var1+var2) #It will give an error as we can't add string to any number
 

<mark>Note – We can add (concatenate) two or more strings and the strings will be concatenated to return another string. Here is the example showing that:</mark>

var1 = "My Name is "

var2 = "Sidd"

var3 = var1+var2+" & I live in Richardson."

print(var1+var2) #It will give output 'My Name is Sidd'

print(var3)
 

<u>Typecasting </u>: Typecasting is a way to change the data type of one data to another i.e. it changes the data type of any variable to some other data type.
I know it's a bit confusing but let me tell you in a simple manner. Suppose there is a string "34" (note string not integer since it is enclosed in double-quotes) and as we 
know we can't add this to an integer number let's say 6. But to do so we can typecast this string to int data type and then we can add 34+6 to get the output as 40. Have a 
look at the program below:
 
# Typecasting on Python:

abc = 5
abc2 = '45'
abc3 = 55.95
xyz = 5.0

abc4=int(abc2)

print(abc+abc4) #output : 50
print(abc+int(abc2)) #output : 50

print(float(abc)+xyz) #It will add 5.0 + 5.0 and will recturn 10.0

#print(str(abc)+45) #It will give an error as abc has been changed into string.
 

There are many functions to convert one data type into another type :
str() – this function allows us to convert some other data type into a string.
int() – this function allows us to convert some other data type into an integer. For example, int("34") returns 34 which is of type integer (int)
float() – this function allows us to convert some other data type into floating-point number i.e. a number with decimals.
input() Function – This function allows the user to receive input from the keyboard into the program as a string. 

<mark>input() function always takes input as a string i.e. if we ask the user to input a number even then it will take it as a string and we will have to typecast it into 
another data type as per the use case. If you enter 45 when input() is called, you will get "45" as a string </mark>

# Input Function in Python :

print("Enter you name:")
name = input()             #It will take input from user

print("Your Name is ",name) #It will show the name

xyz = input("Enter your age :")
print("Your age is ", xyz)
 
<u>Program</u> 
var1 = "54"
var4 = "32"
var2 = 4
var3 = 36.7
# print(100 * str(int(var1) + int(var4)) )
# print(100 * "Hello world\n")
# print("Enter your number")
# inpnum = input()
#
# print("You entered", int(inpnum)+10)
