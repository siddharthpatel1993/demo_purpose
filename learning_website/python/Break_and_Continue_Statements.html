<html><h2><u><center>Break & Continue Statements</u></center></h2>
<h4><pre>
“Break and continue statements are used to alter the flow or normal working of a loop, that could be either a “for loop” or “while loop”.

<u>Defining break statement,</u> break statement alters the normal functionality of the loops by terminating or exiting the loop containing it. The compiler then moves on to the code
that is placed after the body of the loop. 

<u>Example 1 with while loop</u>

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1

<u>Example 2 with for loop</u>


fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
  if x == "banana":
    break  

<u>Continue statement </u>also alters the flow of a normal working loop but unlike the break statement, it takes the compiler to the start of the code that has already been executed 
before the statement but is inside the loop boundary. All the code written after the continue statement is skipped but it is worth noting that the continue statement works
only for a single iteration. Unless in situations where it's written with decision statements such as if, else, etc., in those situations the continue statement will totally 
be dependent upon the condition of the decision statement.

<u>Example 1 with While loop</u>

i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)

<u>Example 2 with for loop</u>  

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    continue
  print(x)

<mark><u>Where and when can these statements come in handy:</u>
When you are working with a big project, there might occur a situation where you only need to use the loop partially without adding new or removing already existing lines of 
codes. You can easily apply the break statement in your code so that you can partially run it without any sort of error.
Or in another situation let’s suppose you are working with while loop printing some lines on the screen and you want to skip an iteration in between others, then you can 
write the continue statement using an “if” statement that matches your need so that you can skip the specific iteration.</mark>

<u>The pass Statement</u>
for loops cannot be empty, but for some reason you have a for loop with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.

Example
for x in [0, 1, 2]:
  pass
