<html><h2><center><u>F-Strings & String Formatting In Python</u></center></h2>
<h4><pre>
-> String formatting is used to design the string using formatting techniques provided by the particular programming language. 
-> From the % formatting to the format() method, to format string literals, there is no limit as to the potential of string crafting. 
-> There are four significant ways to do string formatting in Python. 

<u><h3>#1 String Formatting (% Operator) -</h3></u>
-> Python has a built-in operation that we can access with the % operator. 
-> This will help us to do simple positional formatting. 

Example ->

name="Jack"

n="My name is %s" %name

print(n)

Output: My name is Jack

-> The problem with this method is when we have to deal with large strings. 
-> If we specify the wrong type of input type operator, then it will throw an error. 
-> <mark>For Example, %d will throw a TypeError if the input is not an integer.</mark>

<u><h3>#2 Using Tuple () -</u></h3>
-> The string formatting syntax, which uses % operator changes slightly if we want to make multiple substitutions in a single string. 
-> The % operator takes only one argument, to mention more than one argument, use tuples. 
-> Tuples are better than using the old formatting string method. 
-> However, it is not an ideal way to deal with large strings. 

Example -> 

name="Jack"
class1=5
s="%s is in class %d"%(name,class1)
print(s)

Output: Jack is in class 5.

<u><h3>#3  String Formatting (str.format) -</h3></u>
-> Python 3 introduced a new way to do string formatting. 
-> format() string formatting method eliminates the %-operator special syntax and makes the syntax for string formatting more regular. 
-> str.format() allows multiple substitutions and value formatting. 
-> We can use format() to do simple positional formatting, just like you could with old-style formatting:
-> In str.format(), we put one or more replacement fields and placeholders defined by a pair of curly braces { } into a string.

Syntax: {}.format(values)

Example ->

str = "This article is written in {} "

print (str.format("Python"))
Output: This article is written in Python.

-> This string formatting method is preferred over %-style formatting. 
-> Using the format() method, we can deal with large strings, and the code will become more readable.

<u><h3>#4 Using f-Strings ( f ): </h3></u>
-> Python added a new string formatting approach called formatted string literals or "f-strings." 
-> This is a new way of formatting strings. 
-> A much more simple and intuitive solution is the use of Formatted string literals.
-> f-string has an easy syntax as compared to previous string formatting techniques of Python. 
-> They are indicated by an "f" before the first quotation mark of a string. 
-> Put the expression inside { } to evaluate the result. Here is a simple example

## declaring variables

 str1="Python”

 str2="Programming”

print(f"Welcome to our {str1}{str2} tutorial”)
Output: Welcome to our Python Programming tutorial.

Program:
# F strings
import math

me = "Harry"
a1 =3
# a = "this is %s %s"%(me, a1)
# a = "This is {1} {0}"
# b = a.format(me, a1)
# print(b)
a = f"this is {me} {a1} {math.cos(65)}"
# time
print(a)
