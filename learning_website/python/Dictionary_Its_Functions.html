<html><h2><u><center>Dictionary & Its Functions Explained</center></u></h2>

<h4><pre>Let's start with the basic definition of a Python Dictionary:

<mark>“A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and does not allow duplicates. Each item of the dictionary has a key/value pair.” </mark>

Here are a few important features of a python dictionary:

•	It is unordered (no sequence is required - data or entries have no order, because there is no indexing through number. Happening view key)
•	It is mutable (values can be changed even after its formation or new data/information can be added to the already existing dictionary, we can also pop/remove an entry 
        completely)
•	<mark>It is indexed (Dictionary contains key-value pairs and indexing is done with keys. Also, after the Python 3.7th update the compiler stores the entries in the order 
        they are created)</mark>
•	No duplication of data (each key is unique; no two keys can have the same name so there is no chance for a data override)

Let's look into the syntax of a Python dictionary

a = {'key':'value', 'cow':'mooh'}
print(a['cow'])
#will print "mooh" on the screen


Some distinct features that a dictionary provides are:

•	We can store heterogeneous data into our dictionary i.e. numbers, strings, tuples, and the other objects can be stored in the same dictionary.
•	<mark>Different data types can be used in a single list, which can be made the value of some key in the dictionary. etc. </mark>

Program:

# Dictionary is nothing but key value pairs
d1 = {}
# print(type(d1))
d2 = {"Harry":"Burger",
      "Rohan":"Fish",
      "SkillF":"Roti",
      "Shubham":{"B":"maggie", "L":"roti", "D":"Chicken"}}
# d2["Ankit"] = "Junk Food"
# d2[420] = "Kebabs"
# print(d2)
# del d2[420]
# print(d2["Shubham"])
# d3 = d2.copy()
# del d3["Harry"]
# d2.update({"Leena":"Toffee"})
# print(d2.keys())
