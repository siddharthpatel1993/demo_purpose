<pre><h4>
-> Python file objects give us many methods and attribute that we can use to analyze a file, including tools to figure out the name of the file associated with the file object,
   whether it is closed or opened, writable, readable and how it handles errors.

<h3><u>Tell Function (tell()) -</u></h3>
-> When we are working with python files, there are several ways to present the output of a program, it could be in human-readable form or binary form, or we use read()
   function with specified size to read some data.

-> What if we want to know the position of the file(read/write) pointer.

-> For this purpose, we use the tell() function. f.tell() returns an integer giving the file pointer current position in the file represented as a number of bytes. 

-> File Pointer/File Handler is like a cursor, which defines from where the data has to be read or written in the file. 

-> Sometimes it becomes important for us to know the position of the File Pointer. With the help of tell(), this task can be performed easily. 

Description:
•	Syntax:  tell()
•	Parameters Required: No parameters are required.
•	Return Value:  tell() function returns the current position of the file pointer within the file.

Example:
 f = open("myfile.txt", "r")
print(f.readline() )
print(f.tell())

-> Here the question arises, what if we want to change the position of the file pointer.

-> Here the concept of seek() function comes.

<h3><u>seek() -</u></h3>
-> When we open a file, the system points to the beginning of the file. Any read or write will happen from the start. 

-> To change the file object’s position, use seek(offset, whence) function. 

-> The position will compute by adding offset to a reference point, and the whence argument selects the reference point. 

-> It is useful when operating over an open file. 

-> If we want to read the file but skip the first 5 bytes, open the file, use function seek(5) to move to where you want to start reading, and then continue reading the file.

Description:
•	Syntax:  file_pointer.seek(offset, whence).
•	Offset:   In seek() function, offset is required. Offset is the position of the read/write pointer within the file.
•	Whence: This is optional. It defines the point of reference. The default is 0, which means absolute file positioning.
 
Value	Meaning
0	    Absolute file positioning. The position is relative to the start of the file. The first argument cannot be negative.
1	    Seek relative to the current position. The first argument can be negative to move backward or positive to move forward
2	    Seek relative to the file’s end. The first argument must be negative.
 
Example:
This code will change the current file position to 5, and print the rest of the line.
f = open("myfile.txt", "r")
f.seek(5)
print( f.readline() )
 
<mark>Note: not all file objects are seekable.</mark>
 
Program -
f = open("harry.txt")
f.seek(11)
print(f.tell())
print(f.readline())
# print(f.tell())

print(f.readline())
# print(f.tell())
f.close()

<h3><u>Using With Block To Open Python Files -</u></h3>
-> There is more than one way to open and close a file. The one we have studied till now is using the open() and close() function. 

-> Now Lets see how we can use, with block to open and close a file, including syntax and benefits. We will be using f as our file’s object.

-> Opening and closing of files are necessary and crucial steps in file handling. We cannot read, write, or perform any task on a file without opening it first. Everyone is
   familiar with it because it is the first step in file handling. But what most of us are not familiar with is how vital closing a file is. If we do not close our file 
   after we are done using it, then the file object will keep on consuming processor memory, and also, there will be more chances of exceptions as the file is still open 
   hence, more chances of bugs.

-> To save ourselves from such situations, we could use a with block to open files.

<u>Now how the with block works?</u>
Its syntax is simple:

With open(“file_name.txt”) as f:

f being the object of the file. 
<mark>Note - There is no close() function required. After running the code in the block, the file will automatically be closed. </mark>  

-> What opening a file with "With block" actually does is to create a context manager that automatically closes a file after processing it. 
-> Another benefit of using a “With block” is that we can open multiple files in a single block by separating them using a comma. 
-> All the files could have different modes of opening. For example, we can access one file for reading and another one for writing purposes. 
-> Both files should have different objects referring to them.

The syntax would be:

With open(“file1txt”) as f, open(“file2.txt”) as g
Both files will be simultaneously closed together.

<u>Let us once again briefly go over the advantages of With block:</u>
1. Multiple files can be opened.
2. The files that are opened together can have different modes
3. Automatically closes file
4. Saves processing power by opening and closing file only when running code inside the block
5. Creates a context manager, so lesser chances of an exception occurring

Program:

with open("harry.txt") as f:
    a = f.readlines()
    print(a)
