<html><h2><u><center>While Loops In Python</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre>
“A while loop in python runs a bunch of code or statements again and again until the given condition is true when the condition becomes false, the loop terminates its 
repetition.”

<u>For vs While:-</u>

We generally use for loops for areas where we are already familiar with the number of iterations and use while loop where the number of iterations are unknown. Because 
while loop is solely based on the state of its condition.

program:

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
else:
  print("i is no longer less than 6")
