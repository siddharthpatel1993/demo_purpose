<html><h2><u><center>Python Lists And List Functions</u></center></h2>
<h4><u>Lists:-</u>
<pre>Python lists are containers used to store a list of values of any data type. In simple words, we can say that a list is a collection of elements from any data type E.g.

list1 = ['harry', 'ram', 'Aakash', 'shyam', 5, 4.85]

The above list contains strings, an integer, and even an element of type float. A list can contain any kind of data i.e. it’s not mandatory to form a list of only one data 
type. The list can contain any kind of data in it.

<mark><u>List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members. </u></mark>

Remember we saw indexing in strings? List elements can also be accessed by using Indices i.e. first element of the list has 0 index and the second element has 1 as its index 
and so on.

<mark>Note: If you put an index which isn’t in the list then you will get an error. i.e. if a list named list1 contains 4 elements, list1[4] will throw an error because the list 
index starts from 0 to 3.</mark>

Have a look at the examples below:

<u>List Methods:- </u>
Here is the list of list methods in Python. These methods can be used in any python list to produce the desired output.

Program 1:-
# List Methods:

l1=[1,8,4,3,15,20,25,89,65]   #l1 is a list
print(l1)

l1.sort()  		      #l1 after sorting
print(l1)

l1.reverse()		      #l1 after reversing all elements
print(l1)

Program 2:-
# List Methods :-
list1=[1,2,3,6,5,4] 	# list1 is a list

list1.append(7)			# This will add 7 in the last of list

list1.insert(3,8)		# This will add 8 at 3rd index in list

list1.remove(1)         # This will remove 1 from the list

list1.pop(2)			# This will delete and return index 2 value.

<u>List of List methods</u> - 
1. Append
2. Clear
3. Copy
4. Count
5. Extend
6. Index
7. Insert
8. Pop
9. Remove
10. Reverse
11. Sort

<u>List Slicing:</u>
List slices, like string slices, returns a part of a list extracted out of it. Let me explain, you can use indices to get elements and create list slices as per the following 
format:

seq = list1[start:stop]

Just like we saw in strings, slicing will go from a start index to stop_index-1. It means the seq list which is a slice of list1 contains elements from the specified start 
index to specified stop_index – 1.

Program:

grocery = ["Harpic", "vim bar", "deodrant", "Bhindi",
           "Lollypop", 56]
# print(grocery[5])
numbers = [2, 7, 9, 11, 3]
# numbers.remove(9)
# numbers.pop()
# numbers.sort()
# numbers = []
# numbers.reverse()
# numbers.append(1)
# numbers.append(72)
# numbers.append(5)
# numbers.insert(2, 67)
# print(numbers)
# 3, 11, 9, 7, 2
# print(numbers)
# numbers[1] = 98
# print(numbers)
# Mutable - can change
# Immutable - cannot change
# tp = (1,)
# print(tp)
a= 1
b = 8
a, b = b,a
# temp = a
# a = b
# b = temp
print(a, b)
