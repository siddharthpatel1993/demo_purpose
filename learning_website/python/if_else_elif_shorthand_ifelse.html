<html><h2><u><center>If Else & Elif Conditionals In Python</center></u></h2>

<h4><pre>Let's start today's topic of “If else and elif in python”, with a definition:

“If, else and elif statement can be defined as a multiway decision taken by our program due to the certain conditions in our code.”

Now coming towards a more formal sort of description. “If and else” are known as decision-making statements for our program. They are very similar to the decision making we 
apply in our everyday life that depends on certain conditions.

Let us focus a little on the working:
            Our compiler will execute the if statement to check whether it is true or false now if it’s true the compiler will execute the code in the “if” section of the 
program and skip the bunch of code written in “elif” and “else”. But if the “if” condition is false then the compiler will move towards the elif section and keep on running 
the code until it finds a true statement(there could be multiple elif statements). If this does not happen then it will execute the code written in the “else” part of the 
program.
            
An “if” statement is a must because without an if we cannot apply “else” or “else-if” statement. On the other hand else or else if statement are not necessary because if we 
have to check between only two conditions we use only “if and else” and even though if we require code to run only when the statement returns true and do nothing if it returns 
false then an else statement is not required at all.  

Now Let’s talk about some technical issues related to the working of decision statements:
• There is no limit to the number of conditions that we could use in our program. We can apply as many elif statements as we want but we can only use one “else” 
  and one “if” statement.
• We can use nested if statements i.e. if statement within an if statement. It is quite helpful in many cases.
• Decision statements can be written using logical conditions which are:
    a. Equal to
    b. Not equal to
    c. Less than
    d. Greater than
    e. Greater than equal to
    f. Less than equal to

We can also use Boolean or our custom-made conditions too.

Bonus part:
            As we know that an “if” statement is necessary and you can’t have an “else” or “else-if” without it, but let’s suppose you have a large amount of code and for some 
reason, you have to remove the “if” part of the code (because maybe your code is better without it) but you do not want to do lots of coding again. Then the solution is just 
to write pass instead of the code and this will help your code run without any error without executing the if part.
Code as described in video:

# var1 = 6
# var2 = 56
# var3 = int(input())
# if var3>var2:
#     print("Greater")
# elif var3==var2:
#     print("Equal")
# else:
#     print("Lesser")

# list1 = [5, 7, 3]
# print(15 not in list1)
# if 15 not in list1:
#     print("No its not in the list")

<h3><u>Short-hand if :-</u></h3>
if-expression if(condition) else else-expression

#Short Hand If ... Else
#a = 2
#b = 330
#print("A") if a > b else print("B")

<mark>This technique is known as Ternary Operators, or Conditional Expressions.</mark>

You can also have multiple else statements on the same line:

Example
One line if else statement, with 3 conditions:

a = 330
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")
