<h4><pre>
-> File handling is an important part of any programming language.
-> Python has several functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.

<h2><u>File Handling -</h2></u>
-> The key function for working with files in Python is the open() function.
-> Python has a built-in open() function to open a file.
-> The open() function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.
-> There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file :-
   a. Read("r") - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist   
   b. Append("a") - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist
   c. Write("w") - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist. If exist, then it will overwrite.
   d. Create("x") - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists

-> In addition you can specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode
   a. Text("t") - Default value. Text mode
   b. Binary("b") - Binary mode (e.g. images)
   c. Plus mode("+")- In plus mode, we can read and write a file simultaneously. This mode is mostly used in cases where we want to update our file
   
<u>Syntax -</u>
-> To open a file for reading it is enough to specify the name of the file:

f = open("demofile.txt")

-> The code above is the same as:

f = open("demofile.txt", "rt")

-> Because "r" for read, and "t" for text are the default values, you do not need to specify them.

<h3><u>Open a File on the Server - </u></h3>
-> Assume we have the following file, located in the same folder as Python:

$ cat demofile.txt

Hello! Welcome to demofile.txt
This file is for testing purposes.
Good Luck!

-> To open the file, use the built-in open() function.

-> The open() function returns a file object, which has a read() method for reading the content of the file.
-> We store this file object into a variable which is generally called as a file pointer/file handler.

Example ->
f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.read())

-> If the file is located in a different location, you will have to specify the file path, like this:

Example -> Open a file on a different location:

f = open("D:\\myfiles\welcome.txt", "r")
print(f.read())

<h3><u>Read Only Parts of the File -</u></h3>

-> By default the read() method returns the whole text, but you can also specify how many characters you want to return:

Example -> Return the 5 first characters of the file:

f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.read(5))

<h3><u>Read Line - </u></h3>

-> You can return one line by using the readline() method:

Example -> Read one line of the file:

f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.readline())

-> By calling readline() two times, you can read the first two lines:

Example -> Read two lines of the file:

f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.readline())
print(f.readline())

-> By looping through the lines of the file, you can read the whole file, line by line:

Example -> Loop through the file line by line:

f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
for x in f:
  print(x)

<h3><u>Read Lines - </u></h3>

-> readlines() method reads until the end of the file and returns a list of lines of the entire file.

<h3><u>Close Files -</u></h3>
It is a good practice to always close the file when you are done with it.

Example -> Close the file when you are finish with it.

f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.readline())
f.close()

<mark>Note: You should always close your files, in some cases, due to buffering, changes made to a file may not show until you close the file. </mark>

<h3><u>Write to an Existing File</u></h3>
To write to an existing file, you must add a parameter to the open() function:

"a" - Append - will append to the end of the file

"w" - Write - will overwrite any existing content

Example -> Open the file "demofile2.txt" and append content to the file:

f = open("demofile2.txt", "a")
f.write("Now the file has more content!")
f.close()

#open and read the file after the appending:
f = open("demofile2.txt", "r")
print(f.read())

Example -> Open the file "demofile3.txt" and overwrite the content:

f = open("demofile3.txt", "w")
f.write("Woops! I have deleted the content!")
f.close()

#open and read the file after the appending:
f = open("demofile3.txt", "r")
print(f.read())

<mark>Note: the "w" method will overwrite the entire file.</mark>

<h3><u>Create a New File -</u></h3>
To create a new file in Python, use the open() method, with one of the following parameters:

"x" - Create - will create a file, returns an error if the file exist

"a" - Append - will create a file if the specified file does not exist

"w" - Write - will create a file if the specified file does not exist

Example -> Create a file called "myfile.txt":

f = open("myfile.txt", "x")
Result: a new empty file is created!

Example -> Create a new file if it does not exist:

f = open("myfile.txt", "w")

<mark>“r+” mode: At the beginning of the description, I told you that we would learn reading and writing a file simultaneously. Well, r+ mode is more of a combination of reading and
append than read and write. By opening a file in this mode, we can print the existing content on to the screen by printing f.read() function and adding or appending text to it
using f.write() function.</mark>


<h3><u>Delete a File</u></h3>
To delete a file, you must import the OS module, and run its os.remove() function:

Example -> Remove the file "demofile.txt":

import os
os.remove("demofile.txt")

-> Check if File exist:
To avoid getting an error, you might want to check if the file exists before you try to delete it:

Example -> Check if file exists, then delete it:

import os
if os.path.exists("demofile.txt"):
  os.remove("demofile.txt")
else:
  print("The file does not exist")

-> Delete Folder
To delete an entire folder, use the os.rmdir() method:

Example -> Remove the folder "myfolder"

import os
os.rmdir("myfolder")

<mark>Note: You can only remove empty folders.</mark>
