<html><h3>Functions And Docstrings</h3>
<pre><h4> “Functions in Python can be defined as lines of codes that are built to create a specific task and can be used again and again in a program when called.”

There are two types of functions in the Python language:
•	Built-in functions
•	User-defined functions

<u>Creating a Function</u>

We must know how to define a function in Python in order to create one ourselves. We have to use the def keyword in order to define a function accompanied by the function's
name with a pair of parentheses. The function of parenthesis is to send arguments or parameters to a function. In simple words, parameters can be defined as values that are 
sent in the parenthesis. For example, if a function is used to add two numbers then both the numbers will be passed as parameters in the parenthesis. After parenthesis, a 
colon is used to get in the body of the function. Some functions may return a value to the caller, so in order to get the value, a return statement is put at the end of the
body of the function that gives the value that has been calculated by the function.

<mark>def test_sample():
    print("Hello from a function")</mark>

<u>Calling a Function</u>

Calling a function is very simple, we just have to write the name of the function along with the closing parenthesis. If the function requires some arguments then we write 
those in the parenthesis, but if it does not return anything, then we leave them empty.

<mark>def test_sample():
    print("Hello from a function")

test_sample()</mark>

<u>Docstrings</u>
Docstring is a short form of documentation string. Its purpose is to give the programmer a brief knowledge about the functionality of the function. It must be the first 
string in a function, and it is also an optional string but always good to have it while working on programs having multiple functions. The syntax for writing a docstring 
is very simple as it is just a string written in between three double quotes placed three times (""" """) on either side of the string. But it has to be the first line of 
code in the function’s body. To call a docstring we write the name of the function followed by ._doc_.

<mark>a = int(input("Enter the number a \n"))
b = int(input("Enter the number b \n"))

def func2(a,b):
    '''this is first doc string, you need to check out this one'''
    c = (a+b)/2
    return c

print(func2.__doc__)
print(func2(a,b))</mark></h4><pre></html>
