<h4><pre>
<h3><u>Linux Files</u></h3>
-> In Linux system, everything is a file and if it is not a file, it is a process. 
-> A file doesn't include only text files, images and compiled programs but also include partitions, hardware device drivers and directories. 
-> Linux consider everything as as file.
-> Files are always case sensitive. 

<h3><u>Types of Files:-</u></h3>
1. Regular files (-) => It contain programs, executable files and text files.
2. Directory files (d) => It is shown in blue color. It contain list of files.
3. Special files
   a. Block file (b)
   b. Character device file (c)
   c. Named pipe file (p)
   d. Symbolic link file (l)
   e. Socket file (s)

<h3><u>Linux Create File </u></h3>
There are multiple ways to create a file in Linux. Some conventional methods are as follows:
1. Using cat command
   - The cat command is one of the most used commands in Linux. 
   - It is used to create a file, display the content of the file, concatenate the contents of multiple files, display the line numbers, and more.
   - Syntax: cat > test.txt
   - The above command will create a text file and will enter in the editor mode. 
   - Now, enter the desired text and press CTRL + D key to save and exit the file and it will return to the command line.
   
2. Using touch command
   - The touch command is also one of the popular commands in Linux. 
   - It is used to create a new file, update the time stamp on existing files and directories. 
   - It can also create empty files in Linux.
   - Syntax: touch test1.txt or touch test1.txt test2.txt    
   - If we pass the name of an existing file, it will change the timestamp of that file.
   
Note: The significant difference between touch and cat command is that using cat command, we can specify the content of the file from the command 
      prompt comparatively the touch command creates a blank file.
   
3. Using redirect '>' symbol
    - We can also create a file using the redirect symbol (>) on the command line.
	- To create a file, we just have to type a redirect symbol (>) followed by the file name.
	- This symbol is mostly used to redirect the output.
	- There are two ways to redirect the output.
	- If we use > operator, it will overwrite the existing file, and >> operator will append the output.
	- Syntax: > test5.txt
	
4. Using echo command
    - The echo command is used to create a file, but we should specify the file content on the command line.
    - echo " File content" > test6.txt  

5. Using printf command
    - We can also create a file using printf command. For this we need to specify the file content on the command line.
    - Syntax: printf " File content" > test7.txt
	
6. Using a different text editor like vim, nano, vi
   - We can also create a file using the different text editors like vim, nano, vi, and more.
   - Using Vim text editor
   - Using Nano editor
     - The above command will open the nano text editor. Enter the desired text and press CTRL + X then type y for confirmation of the file changes. 
       Press Enter key to exit from the editor.

<h3><u>Linux File Commands </u></h3>
i. file	=> Determines file type.
ii. touch => Used to create a file.
iii. rm => To remove a file.
iv. cp => To copy a file.
v. mv => To rename or to move a file.
vi. rename => To rename file.

<h3><u>I. File</u></h3>
-> File command is used to determine the file type. 
-> It does not care about the extension used for file. 
-> It simply uses file command and tell us the file type. 
-> Syntax: file filename  

Note: File command tell us the file type with the help of a magic file that contains all the patterns to recognize a file type. 
      Path of magic file is /usr/share/file/magic. For more information enter the command 'man 5 magic'.

<h3><u>File Command Options</u></h3>
i. file -s => Used for special files.
ii. file * => Used to list types of all the files.
iii. file /directory name/* => Used to list types of all the files from mentioned directory.
iv. file [range]* => It will list out all the files starting from the alphabet present within the given range.
    - With the help of this command you can specify a range of the alphabets for the files you want.
    - file [a-y]*
	
<h3><u>II. Touch</u></h3>
-> Touch command is a way to create empty files (there are some other methods also). 
-> You can update the modification and access time of each file with the help of touch command.
-> Syntax: touch filename  or touch myfile1 myfile2  

<h3><u>touch Options</u></h3>
1. touch -a -> 
   - Touch command with option 'a' is used to change the access and change time of a file. By default, it will take the current time of your system
   - Syntax: touch -a filename 

2. touch -m -> 
   - This option will help you to change only the modification time of a file.
   - Syntax: touch -m filename
   
3. touch -r -> To update time of one file with reference to the other file.
   - Syntax: touch -r reference_file filename or touch filename -r reference_file
   
4. touch -t -> To create a file by specifying the time.
   - With this command, you can change the access and modify time of a file by determining a specified time to it.
   - It will modify the time by specified time instead of default time.
   - Format of time will be touch -t YYYYMMDDhhmm.ss   
   
6. touch -c -> It does't create n empty file.
   - Using 'c' option with touch command will not create an empty file, if that file doesn't exist.

<h3><u>III. RM</u></h3>
-> The 'rm' means remove. 
-> This command is used to remove a file. 
-> The command line doesn't have a recycle bin or trash unlike other GUI's to recover the files. 
-> Hence, be very much careful while using this command. 
-> Once you have deleted a file, it is removed permanently.
-> Syntax: rm filename  

<h3><u>rm Options</u></h3>
1. rm *extension -> Used to delete files having same extension.
   - This command can be used to remove all the files ending with same extensions like .pdf, .txt, .odt, .png, etc.
2. rm -r or R -> To delete a directory recursively.
   - With rm '-r' option, you can delete a directory having sub directories inside it. So you don't need to delete sub-directories manually.
3. rm -i -> Remove a file interactively.
   - The option 'i' stands for 'interactivity'. Before deleting a file it will ask you whether you want to delete it or not.
   - To delete a file use command: rm -i
   - To delete a directory use command: rm -ri  
4. rm -rf -> Remove a directory forcefully.
   - Linux rm -rf command deletes directory forcefully. It means a file or directory will be deleted anyhow even if it has read-only permission.
   - To delete a file forcefully, use command: rm -f file_name  
   - To delete a directory forcefully, use command: rm -rf directory name
   
<h3><u>IV. CP</u></h3>  
- 'cp' means copy. 
- 'cp' command is used to copy a file or a directory.
- To copy a file into the same directory syntax will be cp existing_file_name new_file_name  

<h3><u>cp Options -</u></h3>
1. cp -r -> To copy a directory along with its sub dirctories.
   - Option 'r' with the copy command can be used to copy a directory including all its content from a source directory to the destination directory.
   - Syntax: cp -r source_Directory destination_Directory   
2. cp file1 file2 directory_name -> To copy multiple files or directories in a directory.
   - Multiple files or directories can be copied to a destination directory at once. 
   - In this case, target must be a directory. 
   - To copy multiple files you can use wildcards (cp *.extension) having same pattern.
   - Syntax: cp *.extension destinationDirectory   
3. cp -backup -> To backup the existing file before over writing it.
   - If the file you want to copy already exists in the destination directory, you can backup your existing file with the use of this command.
   - Syntax: cp --backup filename destination_Directory  
4. cp -i -> Asks for confirmtion.
   - The cp '-i' option allows you to confirm once before overwriting your file.
   - Syntax: cp -i file_name destination_Directory 
5. cp -l -> To create hard link file.
   - If you want to create a hard link of a file instead of copying that file, you can use option 'l'.
   <mark>- Note: In creating hard link of the file the inode number of the two files will remain same. While in case of copying, inode number changes.</mark>
   - Syntax: cp -l filename destination_Directory  
6. cp -p -> Preserves attribute of a file.
   - The cp '-p' option is used to preserve the properties and attributes of a file. You can also preserve the selected properties which you want.
   - Syntax: cp -p file_name destination_Directory  
7. cp -u -v -> To make sure source file is newer then destination file.
   - The cp -u -v command is used when you want to make sure that destination file is missing or doesn't exist.
   - Syntax: cp -u -v file_names destination_Directory 
   - Giving the command 'cp -u -v' will automatically take care of the already existing file (file1.txt) and will not over write it.
   - This command is useful in copying big files.

<h3><u>V. MV</u></h3>
-> Linux mv command is used to move existing file or directory from one location to another. 
-> It is also used to rename a file or directory. 
-> If you want to rename a single directory or file then 'mv' option will be better to use.

<u>How To Rename a File </u>
While renaming a file the inode number of both the files will remain the same.

<u>How To Rename a Directory </u>
Directories can be renamed in the same way as the files. In this case also inode number will remain the same.

<h3><u>mv Option</u></h3>
1. mv -i -> Asks for permission to over write.
   - If you want to copy a file using 'mv' option and if that file already exists then it will silently over write the existing file.
   - But if you'll use 'i' option then it will first ask for your permission to over write it.
2. mv * -> Move multiple files to a specific directory.
   - This command is used to move all the files from the current directory to another specified directory at once.
3. mv --suffix -> Used to take backup before over writing.
   - This option helps you to have a backup of the destination file before over writing it with the moving file. 
   - The original destinaion file will be replaced by the extension provided with the command.
   - Extension file will denote that it is a backup file.
4. mv -u -> Only move those files that doesn't exist.
   - When you'll use mv *, it moves all the files to the destination directory. 
   - But when you use 'u' option, files that already exist in the destination directory will be automtically skipped and all the other files will be copied.
