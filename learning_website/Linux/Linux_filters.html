<html><h2><u><center>Linux Filters</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre>
-> Linux Filter commands accept input data from stdin (standard input) and produce output on stdout (standard output). 
-> It transforms plain-text data into a meaningful way and can be used with pipes to perform higher operations.
-> These filters are very small programs that are designed for a specific function which can be used as building blocks.
 
<h3><u>Filter Commands</u></h3>
1. cat
-> When cat command is used inside pipes, it does nothing except moving stdin to stout.

Syntax: cat fileName | cat or tac |  cat or tac |. . .  

2. cut
-> Linux cut command is useful for selecting a specific column of a file. 
-> It is used to cut a specific sections by byte position, character, and field and writes them to standard output. 
-> It cuts a line and extracts the text data. 
-> It is necessary to pass an argument with it; otherwise, it will throw an error message.
-> To cut a specific section, it is necessary to specify the delimiter. 
-> A delimiter will decide how the sections are separated in a text file. 
-> Delimiters can be a space (' '), a hyphen (-), a slash (/), or anything else. 
-> After '-f' option, the column number is mentioned.
-> Syntax: cut OPTION... [FILE]...  

Examples of the cut command

i) Cut by using Hyphen as delimiter

-> Syntax: cut -d- -f(columnNumber) fileName    
-> Example: cut -d- -f2 marks.txt or cut -d- -f1 marks.txt    
-> The output will be trimmed from hyphen (-). 

ii) Cut by using Space as delimiter
-> If we want to use space as a delimiter, then we have to quote the space (' ') with the cut command. 
-> Syntax: cut -d ' ' -f(columnNumber) fileName    
-> Example: cut -d ' ' -f2 exm.txt or cut -d ' ' -f5 exm.txt  

iii)Cut by byte position
-> The '-b' option is used to cut a section of line by byte. 
-> Syntax: cut -b byte_number filename  

iv) Cut by character
-> The '-c' option is used to cut a specific section by character. 
-> However, these character arguments can be a number or a range of numbers, a list of comma-separated numbers, or any other character.
-> Syntax: cut -c characters file_name  
-> Example: cut -c 1,6 exm.txt or cut -c 1-3 exm.txt  

V) Cut by complement pattern
-> The '--complement' option is used to cut by the complement. 
-> This option is supported by the BSD version of the cut. 
-> Syntax: cut --complement complement_pattern file_name  
-> The compliment pattern can be a list of bytes, characters, or fields.
-> Example: cut --complement -c 1 exm.txt  
-> The above command will cut the file by the first character and it will display rest. 

3. grep
-> The 'grep' command stands for "global regular expression print". 
-> Syntax: grep searchWord file_name  

<h3><u>grep options</u></h3>
i) grep -v: 
-> The 'grep -v' command displays lines not matching to the specified word.
-> Syntax: grep -v searchWord fileName  

ii) grep -i: 
-> The 'grep -i' command filters output in a case-insensitive way.
-> Syntax: grep -i searchWord fileName  

iii)grep -A/ grep -B/ grep -C
-> grep -A command is used to display the line after the result.
-> grep -B command is used to display the line before the result.
-> grep -C command is used to display the line after and line before the result.
-> You can use (A1, A2, A3.....)(B1, B2, B3....)(C1, C2, C3....) to display any number of lines.
-> Syntax: grep -AlineNumber searchWord fileName or grep -BlineNumber searchWord fileName or grep -ClineNumber searchWord fileName  

4. comm
-> The 'comm' command compares two files or streams. 
-> By default, 'comm' will always display three columns. 
-> First column indicates non-matching items of first file, second column indicates non-matching items of second file, and third column indicates matching items of both the files. 
-> Both the files has to be in sorted order(alphabetically) for 'comm' command to be executed.
-> Syntax: comm file1 file2  

<u>To Display Single Column -</u>
-> If you want to output a single column, you have to specify number of the columns which are not to be displayed.
-> Syntax:
   comm -23 (To display first column)
   comm -13 (To display second column)
   comm -12 (To display third column)

5. sed

6. tee
7. tr
8. uniq
9. wc
10. od
11. sort
12. gzip
