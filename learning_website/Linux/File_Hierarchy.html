<html><h2><u><center>Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre>
-> File system hierarchy standard describes directory structure and its content in Unix and Unix like operating system. 
-> It explains where files and directories should be located and what it should contain.
-> It is maintained by Free Standards Group. 
-> In Unix like operating system everything is considered as a file.
-> Only Linux distributions follow the FHS and that too partially. 
-> Because every distro have their own policy due to which you may notice some differences in the directory tree structure of different distros.
-> If you want to find out information about your system's FHS, enter the command "man hier". It will display directory structure of your system.
-> GoboLinux and NixOS doesn't follow FHS at all, it has its own and completely different policy.

<h3><u>The Root Directory</u></h3>
-> All the directories in the Linux system comes under the root directory which is represented by a forward slash (/). 
-> Everything in your system can be found under this root directory even if they are stored in different virtual or physical devices.

<h3><u>Linux Directories</u></h3>
1. Binary directories	
-> Contains binary or compiled source code files, eg, /bin, /sbin, etc.
-> Binary files are the files which contain compiled source code (or machine code). 
-> They are also called executable files because they can be executed on the computer.
-> Binary directory contains: /bin, /sbin, /lib, /opt

i) bin
-> The '/bin' directory contains user binaries, executable files.
-> Linux commands that are used in single user mode, and common commands that are used by all the users, like cat, cp, cd, ls, etc.
-> The '/bin' directory doesn't contain directories.

Example: ls /bin  

ii) sbin
-> The '/sbin' directory also contains executable files.
-> But unlike '/bin' it only contains system binaries which require root privilege to perform certain tasks.
-> And, they are helpful for system maintenance purpose. e.g. fsck, root, init, ifconfig, etc.

Example: ls /sbin  

iii) lib
-> The '/lib' directory contains shared libraries which are often used by the '/bin' and '/sbin' directories. 
-> It also contains kernel module. 
-> These filenames are identable as ld* or lib*.so.*.
-> For example, ld-linux.so.2 and libfuse.so.2.8.6

Example: ls /lib  
 
Note: 1. /lib/modules: 
         -> The '/lib/modules' stores kernel modules and has a directory for each installed kernel.
         -> Modules are meant to use extra hardware support without making a new kernel.
      2. /lib32 and /lib64: 
         -> During compilation time of libraries you'll encounter through the directories named '/lib32' and '/lib64', Which will clarify register size to be used. 
         -> A 64-bit system may have compatibility for 32-bit binary.

iv) opt
-> The term 'opt' is short for optional. 
-> Its main purpose is to store optional application software packages. 
-> Add-on applications from individual vendors should be installed in '/opt'. 
-> And so in some systems '/opt' is empty as they may not have any add-on application.

2. Configuration directories
-> Contains configuration files of the system, eg, /etc, /boot.
-> The configuration directory contains configured files which configures the parameters and initial settings for some computer programs.
-> Configuration directory have sub-diectories such as - /boot, /etc, 

i) boot
-> The '/boot' directory contains boot loader files which are essential to boot the system. 
-> In other words, they only contain files which are needed for a basic Linux system to get up and going.
-> You may find '/boot/grub' directory which contains '/boot/grub/grub.cfg' which defines boot menu that is displayed before the kernel starts.

Example: ls /boot

ii) etc
-> All the machine related configurtion files are kept in '/etc'. 
-> Almost everything related to the configuration of your system is placed here. 
-> It also contain startup and shutdown shell script which is used to start and stop a program. 
-> All the files are static and text based and no binary files can be placed in this directory.
-> The meaning of 'etc' is very controversial. 
-> Earlier it was referred to as 'Etcetera' because it could contain all the files that did not belong from anywhere else. 
-> But recently its most likely meaning is 'Editable Text Configuration' or 'Extended Tool chest'.
-> Configuration files will have an extension of .conf.

Example: ls /etc

Some common directories of /etc are:
a. /etc/init.d/: 
-> The term 'init' is short for initialization. 
-> This directory contains script to control the system or to start and stop the daemons (background process). 
-> The 'init' is a daemon process that continues running until the system is shut down.
b. /etc/X11/: 
-> The X Window system configuration files are stored in this directory. 
-> The configuration file of graphical display (xorg.conf) is also stored here.
c. /etc/skel/: 
-> The term 'skel' is short for skeleton. 
-> Everything in the system has a skeleton which is called hidden file and is stored in this directory. 
-> It is not an important part in the system and can be deleted but still it serves a specific purpose. 
-> Its purpose is to serve the basic set of files, a basic framework which can be used in the creation of a new user.

3. Data directories	
-> Stores data files, eg, /home, /root, etc.
-> Data directory is used to store data of the system.
-> Data directory contains directories such as - /home, /root, /srv, /media, /mnt, /tmp

i) home
-> The '/home' directory stores users personnel files. 
-> After the '/home' there is a directory which is generally named at the user's name like we have '/home/sidd'. 
-> Inside this directory we have our sub-directories like Desktop, Downloads, Documents, pictures, etc.

Example: ls /home or ls /home/sssit  

Note: -> Tilde (~) sign indicates "/home/sssit". 
      -> For example, if you want to give the command "/home/sssit/Desktop" so instead of writing this you can also write "~/Desktop", both are same.

ii) root
-> The '/root' directory is the home directory of the root user.
-> Please note that '/root' directory is different from (/) root.

iii) srv
-> The term 'srv' is short for service. 
-> The '/srv' directory contains server specific data for services provided by the system like www, cvs, rysync, ftp, etc.

iv) media
-> The '/media' directory acts as a mount point for removable media devices such as CD-Rom, floppy, USB devices, etc.
-> This is newly introduced directory and hence a system can run without this directory also.

Example: ls /media  

v) mnt
-> The term 'mnt' stands for mount. 
-> The '/mnt' directory should be empty and sysadmins can only mount temporary filesystems.

vi) tmp
-> The term 'tmp' stands for temporary. 
-> Data stored in '/tmp' is temporary and may use either disk space or RAM. 
-> When system is rebooted, files under this directory is automatically deleted. 
-> So it is advisable that never use '/tmp' to store important data.

4. Memory directories	
-> Stores device files which doesn't take up actual hard disk space, eg, /dev, /proc, /sys.
-> Memory directory contains files of the whole system. 
-> All the device information, process running indata or system related information are stored in this directory.
-> Memory directory contains the directories such as - /dev, /proc, /sys

i) /dev
-> The term 'dev' is short for device. 
-> As you know in Linux operating system everything is a file. 
-> It appears to be an ordinary file but doesn't take up disk space. 
-> Files which are used to represent and access devices are stored here including terminal devices like usb. 
-> All the files stored in '/dev' are not related to real devices, some are related to virtual devices also.

a. /dev/tty and /dev/pts: 
-> The '/dev/tty' file represents the command line interface that is a terminal or console attached to the system. 
-> Typing commands in a terminal is a part of the graphical interface like Gnome or KDE, then terminal will be represented as '/dev/pts/1' (here 1 is replacable by any 
   another number).

b. /dev/null: 
-> The '/dev/null' file is considered as black hole, it has unlimited storage but nothing can be retrieved from it. 
-> You can discard your unwanted output from the terminal but can't retrieve it back.

ii. proc
-> The term 'proc' is short for process. 
-> Same as '/dev', '/proc' also doesn't take up disk space. 
-> It contains process information. 
-> It is a pseudo filesystem that contains information about running processes. 
-> It also works as virtual filesystem containing text information about system resources.

a. /proc conversation with the kernel: 
-> The '/proc' displays view of the kernel, what the kernel manages and it is a means to directly communicate with the kernel.

Example: ls /proc  

Note: 1. Command "ls /proc" displays content of '/proc'. Many files are named as numbers and some named files are also there.
      2. The '/proc' has some file properties like date, which keeps on updating.
      3. Also most of the files in '/proc' are of 0 bytes yet they contain a lot of data.
      4. Most of the files are readable only, some require root privileges and some are writable.

b. /proc/interrupts: 
-> The '/proc/interrupts' displays the interrupt.

Example: cat /proc/interrupts  

iii) sys
-> The term 'sys' is short for system. 
-> Basically it contains kernel information about hardware. 
-> It was created for Linux 2.6 kernel. 
-> It is a kind of '/proc' and is used for plug and play configuration.

5. Usr (Unix System Resources)	
-> Contains sharable, read only data, eg, /usr/bin, /usr/lib, etc.
-> Although it is pronounced as user but in actual it stands for Unix System Resources. 
-> It is also called secondary hierarchy as it contains binaries, libraries, documentation for all the user applications. 
-> It only contains shareable read-only data.

Example: ls /usr  

-> Some of the /usr sub-directories are /usr/bin, /usr/include, /usr/lib, /usr/share, /usr/local, /usr/src, 

i. /usr/bin
-> The '/usr/bin' directory contains non-essential binary commands for all users. 
-> If you can't find a command in '/bin', search it in '/usr/bin'. 
-> It contains a lot of commands.

ii. /usr/include
-> The '/usr/include' directory contains standard include files for C.

iii. /usr/lib
-> The '/usr/lib' directory contains libraries that are not directly executed by the users. 
-> In other words, it contains binaries for the '/usr/bin' and '/usr/sbin'.

iv. /usr/share
The '/usr/share' directory contains architecture independent (shared) data.

v. /usr/local
-> The '/usr/local' directory is used to install software locally. 
-> It means all the user programs that you'll install from source will be installed here.

vi. /usr/src
-> The term 'src' is short for source. 
-> It is used to store source code like kernel source code with its header files.

6. var (variable directory)	
-> Contains larger size data, eg, /var/log, /var/cache, etc.
-> The term 'var' is short for varible. 
-> Files that have an unexpected size and whose content is expected to change continuously (that's why it is named as variable) during normal operation of the system are 
   stored here. For example, log files, spool files and cache files.

Example: ls /var  

-> Some of the /var sub-directories here: /var/log, /var/cache, /var/spool, /var/lib 

i. /var/log
-> The '/var/log' directory contains all log files.

Example: ls /var/log  

ii. /var/cache
-> The '/var/cache' directory stores application cache data. 
-> Cache data are locally generated by I/O or calculation. 
-> Cache must be able to regenerate or restore the data. 
-> These files can be deleted without any loss of data.

Example: ls /var/cache

iii. /var/spool
-> The '/var/spool' directory is used to spool the files waiting to be processed. 
-> For example, printing queues and mail queues.

Example: ls /var/spool  

iv. /var/lib
-> The '/var/lib' directory stores the files that contains state information like databases. 
-> File's data modifies as their respective programs run.

7. Non-standard directories	
-> Directories which do not come under standard FHS, eg, lost+found, /run, etc.
-> Directories which do not come under the standard FHS are called non-standard directories.
-> Some of the Non-standard directories are as follows: /cdrom, /run, /lost + found

i. cdrom
-> The '/cdrom' directory is not in the standard FHS but cdrom can be mounted on this directory. 
-> Ideally according to standard FHS cdrom should be mounted under '/media'.

ii. run
-> The '/run' directory stores run-time variable data. 
-> Run-time variable data means, data about the running system since last boot. 
-> For eg, running daemons.

Example: ls /run  

iii. lost + found
-> During system crash or in any other situation when Linux file system checker (fsck) recovers lost data, that data is stored in this directory. 
-> Data may or may not be in a good condition.
