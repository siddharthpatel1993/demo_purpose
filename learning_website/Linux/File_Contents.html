<html><h2><u><center>File Contents</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre>
-> There are many commands which help to look at the contents of a file.
-> Some of them are mentioned below.

1. head	=> It displays the beginning of a file.
2. tail => It displays the last part of a file.
3. cat => This command is versatile and multi worker.
4. tac => Opposite of cat.
5. more => Command line displays contents in pager form that is either in more format.
6. less => Command line displays contents in pager form that is either in less format.

<h3><u>1. HEAD</h3></u>
-> The 'head' command displays the starting content of a file. 
-> By default, it displays starting 10 lines of any file.
-> Syntax: head file_name
-> If we'll write two file names then it will display first ten lines of each file separated by a heading.
-> The 'head -n' option displays specified number of lines. ( eg - head -15 file.txt or head -n15 file.txt or head -n 15 file.txt )
-> The 'head -c' command counts the number of bytes of a file. (Syntax: head -c number file_name)  
-> Bytes counting has only one syntax unlike lines counting.
-> If you'll use "head -c numberk file_name then it will return the result by multiplying the number by suffix. 
-> Suffix can be "b (bytes=512), k(kilobytes=1024) and m (megabytes=1048576)".

<h3><u>2. TAIL</h3></u>
-> Linux tail command is used to display the last ten lines of one or more files. 
-> Its main purpose is to read the error message. 
-> By default, it displays the last ten lines of a file. 
-> Additionally, it is used to monitor the file changes in real-time. 
-> It is a complementary command of the head command.
-> Syntax: tail file_name
-> The '-n' option displays the specified number of lines from the last. (tail -n number file_name)
-> We can also omit the letter 'n' instead, and we can use the hyphen (-) and the number without any space. ( tail -number file_name)
-> The '-c' option displays the specified number of bytes from the last. (tail -c number file_name)  
-> We can also use the suffix with the number such as b, kb, k, MB, and more to specify the number of bytes. 
-> These suffixes multiplied the specified number as - b: multiplies it by 512, kb: multiplies it by 1000, k: multiplies it by 1024, MB: multiplies it by 1000000.
-> To track a file for changes, the '-f' option is used. Here, '-f' stands for the following. It is useful for monitoring log files. (tail -f num.txt).
-> We can display multiple files from last at once by executing the tail command. 
-> To display the multiple files, provide the file names as input. It will display the last ten lines of specified files. ( tail file_name1 file_name2)
-> The tail command can be used with other commands. It can be piped to other commands to filter the output. (ls -t /etc | tail -n 6)
-> Let's execute the tail command with ps command to display the top running process: ps aux | sort -nk +3 | tail -2    

<h3><u>3. CAT</h3></u>
-> The 'cat' command is the most universal and powerful tool. 
-> It is considered to be one of the most frequently used commands. 
-> It can be used to display the content of a file, copy content from one file to another, concatenate the contents of multiple files.
-> It can also be used to display the line number, display $ at the end of the line, etc.
-> Syntax: cat file_name or     
-> To display the content of multiple files at once, type file names in one single line like "cat file1 file2 file3... fileN". 

<h3><u>Cat command usage</u></h3>
i. cat > [fileName] -> To create a file.
   - The 'cat' command can be used to create a new file with greater than sign (>).
   - Syntax: cat > file_name
   - The 'cat' command with double greater than sign (>>) append (add something in the last of a file) something in your already existing file.
   - Syntax: cat >> (file name)  
ii. cat [oldfile] > [newfile] -> To copy content from older to new file.
   - The 'cat' command can be used to copy the content of a file into another file.
   - cat (older file name) > (newer file name)  
iii. cat [file1 file2 and so on] > [new file name] -> To concatenate contents of multiple files into one.
   - The 'cat' command can be used to concatenate the contents of multiple files in a single new file.
   - Syntax: cat filename1 filename2....  > newFilename 
   -  A new line will be inserted while concatenating multiple files by using a hyphen (-). (syntax: cat - file_name1 file_name2. . . . > new_file_name)  
   - Line will be inserted at the beginning of the file only.
iv. cat -n/cat -b [fileName] -> To display line numbers.
   - The 'cat -n' option displays line numbers in front of each line in a file. (Syntax: cat -n file_Name)
   - The 'cat -b' option removes the empty lines. (Syntax: cat -b (file name))  
v. cat -e [fileName] -> To display $ character at the end of each line.
   - The 'cat -e' option displays a '$' sign at the end of every line. (Syntax: cat -e file_Name)  
vi. cat [fileName] << EOF Used as page end marker.
   - The 'cat << EOF ' option displays an end marker at the end of a file. 
   - It is called here directive and file content will be saved at the given end marker.
   - The file can be saved with the help of 'ctrl + d ' keys also. It works like the end marker.
   - Any word other than 'EOF' can be used for the end marker.
   - Syntax: cat << EOF     
vii. When cat command is used inside pipes, it does nothing except moving stdin to stout.
   - Syntax: cat fileName | cat or tac |  cat or tac |. . .  
   
<h3><u>4. TAC</h3></u>
-> The 'tac' command is the reverse of the 'cat' command. 
-> It is also known as 'cat' backward. 
-> It will display the file content in reverse order. 
-> It prints the last line first, then second last and so on. Such way, it prints the first line at last.
-> Syntax: tac file_name 
-> The 'tac --separator' command will separate the content from the mentioned string or keyword from the rest of the file content. (tac file_name --separator "string")

<h3><u>5. MORE</h3></u>
-> As 'cat' command displays the file content. Same way 'more' command also displays the content of a file. 
-> Only difference is that, in case of larger files, 'cat' command output will scroll off your screen while 'more' command displays output one screenful at a time.
-> Following keys are used in 'more' command to scroll the page:
   - Enter key: To scroll down page line by line.
   - Space bar: To go to next page.
   - b key: To go to the backward page.
   - / key: Lets you search the string.
   - Syntax: more file_name
   - The 'more' command can't be used to display binary files.
   
<h3><u>Linux more options</u></h3>
i. more -num => Limits the line displayed per page. (more -5)
ii. more -d => Displays user message at right corner.
iii. more -s => Squeeze blank lines.
iv. more +/string name => It helps to find the string.
v. more +num => Used to display the content from a specific line.

<h3><u>6. LESS</h3></u>
-> The 'less' command is same as 'more' command but include some more features.
-> It automatically adjust with the width and height of the terminal window, while 'more' command cuts the content as the width of the terminal window get shorter.
-> Syntax: less file_name  
-> A particular string is searched by typing forward slash (/) and then followed by the string name, at place of file name in the lower left corner of the terminal box.

<u>Less Command Navigation Keys</u>
-> The 'less' command have navigation keys similar to the 'vim' editor. 
-> Let's have a look on some of the navigation keys and other operations of less command.

i. Search Navigation
-> Search navigation keys will help you in forward and backward search.

a. Forward search

/ : search for a pattern for the next occurrence
n : search for next match
N : search for previous match

b. Backward search

? : search for a pattern for the next occurrence
n : for next match in backward direction
N : for previous match in forward direction

c. Search path

Forward : /\/home\/sssit\/

Backward : /home/sssit

ii. Screen Navigation

Ctrl + f : forwards one window
Ctrl + d : forwards half window
Ctrl + b : backwards one window
Ctrl + u : backwards half window

iii. Line Navigation (to move forward or backward line by line)

j : forward by one line
k : backward by one line

iv. other Navigations

G : used to go to end of the file
g : used to go to start of the file
q or ZZ : to exit

v. Count Keys

10j : 10 lines forward
10k : 10 lines backward

vi. Marked Navigation

ma : mark current position with letter 'a'
a : go to marked position

vii. Multiple File

by passing arguments in the same line
less file1 file2  
while viewing file1 go to file2
less file1  
      
:e file2  
to navigate between files when more then two files are opened

n : go to next file
p : go to previous file
