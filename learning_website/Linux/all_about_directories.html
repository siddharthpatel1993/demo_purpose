<h3><u>What are Commands?</u></h3>
-> A command is an instruction given to our computer by us to do whatever we want. We run the commands in terminal on Mac OS and Linux, whereas, in windows it is called 
   command prompt. 
-> Commands are always case sensitive.
-> This command further passes to the shell which reads the command and execute it. 
-> Shell is a method for the user to interact with the system. 
-> Default shell in Linux is called bash (Bourne-Again Shell).

There are two types of shell commands:

1. <u>Built-in shell commands:</u> They are part of a shell. Each shell has some built in commands.
2. <u>External/Linux commands:</u> Each external command is a separate executable program written in C or other programming languages.

<h3><u>Linux Home Directory -</u></h3>
-> The Linux home directory is a directory for a particular user of the system and consists of individual files. 
-> It is also referred to as the login directory. 
-> This is the first place that occurs after logging into a Linux system. 
-> It is automatically created as "/home" for each user in the directory'. 
-> It is a standard subdirectory of the root directory. 
-> The root directory contains all other directories, subdirectories, and files on the system. It is denoted by a forward slash (/).
-> The home directory can be said as a personal working space for all the users except root. 
-> There is a separate directory for every user. For example, two users 'jtp1' and 'jtp2' will have directories like "/home/jtp1" and "/home/jtp2". 
-> These users will have all the rights under their directory files.
-> The root (administrative) user is the only user who has its home directory in a different location by default. 
-> The path of the root user is '/root/', where it has control under all the directories and files.

<h3><u>How to find the Home Directory?</u></h3>
1. We can get back to our home directory by executing the cd command without any argument from any directory we are working on.
=> cd  

Note: We can use the "cd ~, cd $HOME or cd $home" commands as well for the same purpose.

<h3><u>Difference between Root and Home Directory</u></h3>

<u>Root Directory</u>	
1. The root directory is the topmost level of the system drive.	
2. It is denoted by a slash '/'.	
3. The admin has access to make any changes in the files and settings.	
4. The admin can create a user.	
5. In the Linux file system, everything comes under the root directory.	


<u>Home Directory</u>
1. The home directory is a subdirectory of the root directory.
2. It is denoted by '~' and has path "/users/username".
3. No user other than the root user can change the settings of the entire system.
4. Any user having a home directory cannot create a user.
5. The home directory contains a particular user's data.

<h3><u>Linux Directory Commands -</u></h3>
i. pwd => The pwd command stands for (print working directory). It displays the current working location or directory of the user. It displays the whole working path starting 
          with /. It is a built-in command.
ii. ls => The ls command is used to show the list of a folder. It will list out all the files in the directed folder.
iii. cd => The cd command stands for (change directory). It is used to change to the directory you want to work from the present directory.
iv. mkdir => With mkdir command you can create your own directory.
v. rmdir => The rmdir command is used to remove a directory from your system.

<h3><u>I. PWD</u></h3>
=> Linux pwd (print working directory) command displays your location currently you are working on. 
=> It will give the whole path starting from the root and ending to the directory.

Syntax: pwd  

<h3><u>II. CD</u></h3>
=> Linux cd command is used to change the current working directory ( i.e., in which the current user is working). 
=> The "cd" stands for 'change directory.' 
=> It is one of the most frequently used commands in the Linux terminal.

Syntax: cd dirname
  
There are some following common task we can do using cd command -
1. Change from the current directory to a new directory (cd /path/to/the/directory)
2. Change directory using an absolute path (cd /path/to/the/directory)
3. Change directory using the relative path ( cd path/to/the/directory)
4. Change to the home directory ( cd ~)
5. Change to the previous directory ( cd -)
6. Change to Parent Directory ( cd ..) 
7. Change to the root directory ( cd / )
8. Change to another user's home directory ( cd ~username)
9. Change to Directory having Spaces (cd 'Dir name with space' or cd Dir\ name\ with\ space)
10. Change up to multiple Sub Directories ( cd Dir1/Dir2/Dir3)  

<h3><u>III. LS</u></h3>
=> The ls is the list command in Linux. It will show the full list or content of your directory. Just type ls and press the enter key. The whole content will be shown.

Syntax: ls  

<u>ls command options:-</u>
1. ls -a => In Linux, hidden files start with .(dot) symbol and they are not visible in the regular directory. The (ls -a) command will enlist the whole list of the current 
            directory including the hidden files.
2. ls -l => It will show the list in a long list format.
3. ls -lh => This command will show you the file sizes in human readable format. Size of the file is very difficult to read when displayed in terms of byte. The (ls -lh)
             command will give you the data in terms of Mb, Gb, Tb, etc.
4. ls -lhS => If you want to display your files in descending order (highest at the top) according to their size, then you can use (ls -lhS) command.
5. ls -l --block-size=[SIZE] => It is used to display the files in a specific size format. Here, in [SIZE] you can assign size according to your requirement.
                                 - You can replace [SIZE] with the following measures:
                                 - K = Kilobyte, M = Megabyte, G = Gigabyte, T = Terabyte, P = Petabyte, E = Exabyte, Z = Zettabyte ,Y = Yottabyte  
6. ls -d */ => It is used to display only subdirectories.
7. ls -g or ls -lG => With this you can exclude column of group information and owner.
8. ls -n => It is used to print group ID and owner ID number instead of their names.
9. ls --color=[VALUE] => This command is used to print list as colored or discolored. Value can be auto or never.
10. ls -li => This command prints the Inode number of file is in the first column.
11. ls -p => It is used to identify the directory easily by marking the directories with a slash (/) line sign.
12. ls -r => It is used to print the list in reverse order.
13. ls -R => It will display the content of the sub-directories also.
14. ls -lX => It will group the files with same extensions together in the list.
15. ls -lt => It will sort the list by displaying recently modified filed at top.
16. ls ~ => It gives the contents of home directory.
17. ls ../ => It give the contents of parent directory.
18. ls --version => It checks the version of ls command.

<h3><u>IV. MKDIR</u></h3>
=> The mkdir stands for 'make directory'. 

Syntax: mkdir dirname  or mkdir dirname1 dirname2 dirname3 ...  

<u>Mkdir Options :-</u>
1. mkdir -p, -parents => 
   - With the help of mkdir -p command you can create sub-directories of a directory. 
   - It will create parent directory first, if it doesn't exist. 
   - But if it already exists, then it will not print an error message and will move further to create sub-directories. 
   - Syntax: mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3
2. mkdir -v, -verbose => 
   - Print a message for each created directory/new file.
   - Syntax: mkdir -v dir1 dir2 dir3
   - If file alreday exist then it will give an error message.
   - mkdir -pv/ mkdir -vp (Both the commands 'mkdir -pv' and 'mkdir -vp' are same. By combining -p you can create a long list files together like 
     "dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4/dir5" with a printed message for each file.)
   - It will not throw error message from alreday created files or directory.
3. mkdir -m, -mode=MODE =>
   - With the help of this command, you can give permission access on the directory you are creating. 
   - Access means to give the authority to read(r), write(w), and execute(x). 
   - You can give the permission access in different ways to your directory.
   - For full access, command will be "mkdir -m=rwx file" or "mkdir -m 777 file".  
   - For read and write, command will be "mkdir -m=rw file"  
   - For read only/ write only/ execute only, command will be "mkdir -m=r file"/ "mkdir -m=w file"/ "mkdir -m=x file"

<h3><u>V. RMDIR</u></h3>
- This command is used to delete a directory. 
- But will not be able to delete a directory including a sub-directory. It means, a directory has to be empty to be deleted.
- Syntax: rmdir dirname  
- rmdir -p (This command will delete a directory including its sub-directories all at once)
