<html><h2><u><center>All about Process in Linux</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre>
-> Process means do something.

<h3><u>What is Linux process?</u></h3>
-> Every program that you execute is running in a process. Program under execution.
-> Example - ps, ps -o pid,ppid,tty,uid,args

<u>TTY (Terminal Name) -</u>
-> This is a identifier of the terminal session that triggered this process.
-> That's called the controlling terminal.
-> Almost every process will be attached to a terminal (except for daemons).
Example - $ tty
          /dev/pts/0
          /dev/pts/1
		  
<u>UID (UserID)-</u>
-> It will be the owner of the process.
-> It will define the permissions this process has.
Example - $ id -u ubuntu

<u>ARGS -</u>  		  
-> The command (followed by its arguments) that's running in this process.

<h3><u>How process is born?</u></h3>
-> Process creation is achieved in 2 steps in a unix system, the fork (child) and the exec (own).
-> Every process always exit with a exit code between 0 and 255.
-> 0 indicates success.
-> Non-zero value indicates different type of errors. ( Syntax - $?)
-> First process in linux triggered by init. (ps value or PID value 1 - init command) 

Daemon Processes:
-> A process that runs in the background, and is not attached to a controlling terminal. (Example: Database and web servers)
-> Lots of daemons that are responsible for keeping your system healthy.
-> There is one specially important daemon, the first process created on the system: the init process. It's parent or grandparent of all the processes.
-> The init process can spawn new processes that will be daemons, or a process can become a daemon by being intentionally made an orphan, as we saw before (forking a child 
   and immediately existing)
-> Daemons names usually end with a "d": syslogd, launchd, sshd, httpd etc.
-> But if these daemons are not attached to a terminal, how can someone actually terminate these processes -> sending them a signal.

Zombie Processes:
-> If a child process exits for some reason, the parent doesn't/fails to call wait.
-> The process doesn't really exist anymore, but still appears in the process table.
-> The table will show a status z for the zombies.
-> This state is possible because the kernel cannot fully dispose a process when it exists, otherwise no one would able to read its exist code, so it just waits until the 
   parent
   performs a call to wait, and then it can be fully removed.
-> Every process stay in a zombie state, at least fir a short period of time, between the moment it exists, and the moment the parent reads its exist code.   

Orphan Processes:
-> A process whose parent process no more exists i.e. either finished or terminated without waiting for its child process to terminate is called the orphan process.
-> Child Process still is in running state, but its parent process terminates.
-> what happens is that the child process is "adopted" by the initial process, the first process that is executed in the system, usually called init (launched).
-> PPID (parentid) of a orphaned process with be 1.
-> A process can be orphaned unintentionally, when the parent process crashed, for instance, but it also can be orphaned intentionally, usually when you want a long running 
   process to be detached from a user session, as is the case of daemons processes.
   
fg and bg:
fg is what we run/trigger, interacts with the user.
bg is what is run/trigger y OS without any user interaction (daemon process)
& -> runs a process in bg.

Signals:
-> It is system call used to send a process a signal to kill.
-> Run kill -l to see the list of available signals.
-> Each one of these signals also have an equivalent numeric value.
-> Example: kill -> 9
-> You can send a signal to a process with a kill command.
-> Kill vim process that is running (with PID 22222):
$ kill -KILL 22222
$ kill -SIGKILL 22222
$ kill -9 22222

-> When you hit ctrl-c to terminate a program in your terminal, a SIGNINT signal (INTERRUPT) is sent to a running process, and as consequence, it will terminate.
-> Exception is the init process: Ignores SIGKILL or a SIGSTOP signal.
